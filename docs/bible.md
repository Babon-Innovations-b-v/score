# The bible

The single source of truth for how this system works. One file, chaptered. A chapter ID is the
slug after the `##` (for example `architecture/system-context`), and the chapter map in root
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) points at it; link to a chapter as `docs/bible.md#architecturesystem-context`.

**How to use it.** Read the chapter the work touches, never the whole file. When you learn
something load-bearing that a future reader would otherwise have to re-derive from code, write it
into its chapter in the same session. When a chapter contradicts the code, the code wins and the
chapter gets fixed on the spot.

**What does not go here.** Vocabulary goes in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md). Decisions that were
hard to reverse go in [`docs/adr/`](adr/). Status of ongoing work goes on its GitHub issue. The
bible holds how the thing works, not what we are doing about it.

A chapter that is still a placeholder says so in one line. An empty chapter is honest; an invented
one is not.

## architecture/system-context

<The big picture in one screen: what this system is, who or what talks to it, what it talks to.
Placeholder until the first real component exists.>

## architecture/components

The framework moved here from the game 2099 on 2026-10-08 (JoeyKardolus/2099#129), with its history (git
filter-repo on the moved paths). Two sides: the coordinating machine runs plain Python (plans, labels, checks, the
scene package; `.venv` from `pyproject.toml`), and every step that loads a model, bakes or renders runs on a rented
cloud machine that deletes itself (`tools/props/cloud/`, through the provider interface `provider.py`; Scaleway is
the current backend). No model runs on the coordinating machine.

- `tools/props/`: the prop pipeline (close-up to Pixal3D in a cloud batch, `cloud/batch.py`; finish; `pixal.py`),
  the scene tools (`scene/`: concepts, the world step, close-ups, inventories, layouts), the surface library and its
  piece making (`library/`: recipes, labels by parts, `make_chunky`/`make_kit` baked in the cloud, `route.py` for kit
  rooms, `place_route.py` for outdoor places, `package.py` for the scene package), the gates (`gates/`), Infinigen
  grounds and life (`infinigen/`). Each directory's rules are in its overlay.
- `tools/blender/`: the headless Blender launcher (never a window on the owner's screen).
- `tools/sound/`: the sound picker and the loudness rule; MOSS takes are made in the cloud.
- `data/library/`: the surface library (materials, fittings, composites, details per kind, printed pictures);
  `data/fonts/`: the fonts printed labels use (SIL OFL).
- The first world's data, the game 2099's, read as the example world: `data/definitions/place.json` (each place's
  style, palette, materials, wear), `design/tokens/tokens.json` (the palette), `data/inventory/` (scene
  inventories), `data/kit/` (laid kit rooms), `data/sound/` (sound briefs). Some tools still name the game's files
  (`route.py install`, the sound picker's apply, `inventory.py`'s shell hash): that is the game's adapter, to move out
  when 2099 consumes the package.
- `vendor/`: third-party tools as released, each pinned with its licence (ADR-0002).

**The output** of a place is its scene package (`package.py`): `objects/<name>.gltf` per object as baked, and
`scene.json` (`score.scene` v1: metres, y up, each copy's transform, its inventory row, its model check). The game's
Godot adapter stays in 2099. OpenUSD as the canonical scene format is the next task.

## architecture/lifecycles

**One outdoor place, end to end** (the wreck is the worked example; commands in the README):

1. The place's record: its picked concept, its scene inventory (`data/inventory/<place>.json`, one row per object
   with its size and spots), each kind's turn and allowed materials in `data/library/details.json`, and one close-up
   per generated row. Recorded inputs live in the work folder (`PROPS_WORK`), not in git (the pictures are large).
2. Pixal3D models from the close-ups, one cloud batch (`cloud/batch.py`, refused without the approved inventory).
3. PartCrafter parts from each model's cut-out (`cloud/parts.py`), the painting unit.
4. Labels: every part one allowed library material (`library/labels.py`), checked for patchy paint; a take too long
   for one piece is split (`place_route.py split`).
5. The plan and the bake jobs (`place_route.py plan`), baked in the cloud (`cloud/library_bake.py`, `--processor`
   when no card is in stock).
6. The model gate and straightness (`place_route.py check`).
7. The scene package and its check (`package.py`).

## build/release

Nothing is released yet but the paper. Commands, run locally (there is no CI and no GitHub Actions):

- `make paper`: builds the paper from `paper/source/score.md` with pandoc into `paper/out/score.tex`
  and `score.pdf` (citeproc, IEEE style) and into the arXiv tree `paper/arxiv/` (`main.tex`,
  `content/`, `figures/`, `refs.bib`, `main.bbl`, `main.pdf`). PDF engine: xelatex if installed,
  else tectonic. The build writes `paper/out/stamp.json`, the sha256 of every input (draft,
  bibliography, style, filter, figures, the build script) and every output.
- `make check`: the gate. `gate-scope.py` decides whether tests run (`paper/` counts as a build
  input, not a document); the tests include `paper/build/test_paper_current.py`, which fails when
  the files on disk no longer match the stamp, so a draft changed without a rebuild, or a
  generated file edited by hand, is red. Then the ADR index check.
- `make env` builds the framework's Python environment (`.venv`, `uv sync`); `make tests` runs every framework
  check (`tools/**/*_test.py`, plain scripts, each under a 16 GB memory cap), or only the ones named with
  `TESTS="..."`. `make check` runs them when code changed. While working, run only the checks your change touches.
  Render checks run Blender headless on a cloud machine, never here; nothing here runs Godot.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` (installed by `bootstrap.sh` as `core.hooksPath`) runs the same check on
  any commit that touches `paper/`. A green run means the committed PDF is the draft's.

**Scope the gate.** Running every test on every push stops scaling once several sessions work
side by side on one machine. The project's test command asks
`python3 .claude/scripts/gate-scope.py` first and reads its `MODE` line: `none` when the change
touches only documents and working notes (`.md`, `docs/`, `.claude/`), so nothing runs; `full`
otherwise. When the full run grows slow, grow the script into a graph that picks only the suites
a change can reach, and keep its rules:

- **Unknown means full.** A path the scope does not recognise, a file that went away and could
  have been named by something, no origin/main to compare with, `--full`, `GATE_FULL=1`, or a run
  on CI: everything runs. A new kind of path goes to full, never to "none".
- **A change to the gate itself runs everything**: the test runner, its config, vendored test
  frameworks, the CI workflow.
- **CI always runs everything.** It is the net under a test the scope misses, so it stays
  unscoped.
- **The scope has its own check against the real tree**: every suite is chosen when the file it
  is named after changes, and an exception is written down with the reason.
- **Print the reasons**, one line each, so whoever reads the gate's output sees what was skipped.

A grown version to copy from: the game 2099's `tools/test/scope/` (Godot scripts, scenes and
`res://` paths).

## workflow/loop

The working loop, and the mechanisms that keep it from drifting.

**The loop.** Every conversation in this repo is a task, and it runs the same four steps.

1. **grill** — the first message in any conversation goes here, enforced by the `SessionStart`
   hook. Grill orients silently (the prompt, `.claude/soul.md`, root `CLAUDE.md`, the `CONTEXT.md`
   glossary, the bible chapters the prompt touches, the related GitHub issues), then interviews the
   plan one question at a time until the plan and the domain model agree. Facts get looked up, not
   asked. Decisions get asked, not assumed.
2. **to-prd** — the aligned plan becomes one PRD epic: a GitHub issue with a goal, a scope, a task
   list and a verifiable definition of done. No re-interviewing. A task that is independently
   grabbable, or that is going to an agent, is carved out as a natively linked sub-issue; everything
   else stays a checklist line.
3. **code** — the work itself, against the PRD.
4. **close** — ship what is done, write where the PRD stands, park every loose end under a parent
   PRD, and close the issue only when its acceptance list is genuinely met.

Two branches off step 1. A **brain dump** (several open questions at once, visionary thinking, a
pasted conversation) goes to `brain-dump`, which sorts it into claims, questions, decisions and
vision, sweeps and refutes, and lands each result in its own home. An effort that is **too big and
too fogged** for one session goes to `wayfinder`, which charts it as a PRD whose route is unknown
and breaks the fog into investigation sub-issues, one resolved per session.

**The mechanism stack.** Four types, one job each. Mixing them makes harness behaviour
unpredictable.

- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) hold methodology. Invoked by name (`/grill`) or by
  the model when the description matches.
- **Overlays** (`<area>/CLAUDE.md`) hold the rules for one directory and auto-load when a file in
  it is touched. A new code directory gets one without asking; it is the mechanism, not a document.
- **Hooks** (`.claude/settings.json`) hold automation that must fire on a harness event, not on the
  model remembering. Today: the grill protocol on `SessionStart`, the soul rules on every prompt,
  `md_guard` and `issue_guard` on `PreToolUse`, and the memory commit-and-push on `Stop`.
- **GitHub issues** hold the durable backlog. Anything that must survive the chat lives there.

**The board.** One GitHub project, created by `.claude/scripts/setup-github.py --board`. Status is
a board column, never a label: `LowPriority`, `Not started`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`. Set it
with `python3 .claude/scripts/board-status.py <issue> "In Progress"`. Triage state is a label
(`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) and is a different
axis from the column; do not confuse them.

**Before you push.** Run the project's own test command (scoped by
`.claude/scripts/gate-scope.py`, see build/release), and
`python3 docs/adr/tools/check_index.py`. Both must exit clean. The push is the ship: this repo
works on `main` only (ADR-0001), so a push is visible to everyone immediately and there is no PR
step to catch anything you skipped.

**Commits.** Imperative and scoped: `module: description`. The scope is the module or area, not the
file. A commit that needs "and" in its subject line is two commits.

**Memory.** Claude's memory folder is linked into `.claude/memory` by
`.claude/scripts/bootstrap.sh`, and that folder is git-ignored: this repository is public, and
memory is private working notes. The `Stop` hook's memory commit finds nothing to commit. Memory
therefore does not survive a wiped machine; anything load-bearing goes into the bible, the
glossary or an issue instead.

## workflow/module-standard

The house standard for a module in this repo. It exists so that a reader can predict the shape of
code they have not seen yet.

- **One interface, one directory.** A module is a directory with an obvious way in. Callers import
  the way in, never a file inside it. Files that are not part of the interface are private
  (`_prefix` in Python, not exported in TypeScript, package-private in Java).
- **Deep over shallow.** A module earns its existence by hiding more than it exposes. If its
  interface is nearly as complicated as its implementation, it is a shallow module and belongs
  inlined into its caller. Vocabulary and the full argument:
  [`.claude/skills/improve-codebase-architecture/LANGUAGE.md`](../.claude/skills/improve-codebase-architecture/LANGUAGE.md).
- **One function, one purpose.** If the docstring needs "and" between two concerns, it is two
  functions.
- **Tests sit with the module** they test, named for the invariant rather than the function
  (`test_<invariant>`), and drive the module through its public interface. A test that reaches into
  the implementation freezes the implementation.
- **Failures propagate.** A write that can fail raises; it does not log and continue. The two tiers
  are: a failure the caller can do something about (raise a typed error) and a failure nothing can
  be done about (crash loudly). Swallowing is neither.
- **Every directory carries its overlay** (`CLAUDE.md`) once it has rules of its own.

<Extend this chapter with the specifics this project needs: the layer names, the test command, the
directory layout. The rules above hold whatever the language is.>

## workflow/bootstrap

Getting a fresh machine, or a wiped one, back to working.

1. Clone the repo, and install the GitHub CLI so `gh auth status` is green. The skills that touch
   issues and the board go through `gh`; without it, `to-prd`, `triage`, `close` and `my-issues`
   cannot run.
2. `bash .claude/scripts/bootstrap.sh`. It links `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-repo-path>/memory` to
   the repo's git-ignored `.claude/memory` (private, never pushed), and reports anything else
   that is missing. It is safe to re-run; every step skips what is already done.
3. `python3 .claude/scripts/setup-github.py --board` on a fresh repo only. Labels and the board are
   GitHub-side state and are not copied by "Use this template", so a repo spawned from the template
   starts without them.

**The framework's runtime** lives outside the repo, under `PROPS_HOME` (default `~/.farm-factory-props`, the first
world's name, kept so the cloud ledger, keys and work carry over): `cloud/` (the runner's ssh key, the self-delete
key, the spend ledger), `work/` (`PROPS_WORK`: takes, pictures, places' runs). The machines need `uv`, `make env`,
and the cloud backend's tools: for Scaleway, the current backend, the `scw` CLI logged in to the project named by
`SCORE_SCALEWAY_PROJECT` (by name, never an id).

**What survives a wipe:** everything in git. **What does not:** Claude's memory (git-ignored,
because the repository is public), `gh` auth, any local toolchain, and anything a session left
uncommitted.

## Identifiers

IDs, secret names. Keep it a table. Anything secret goes in a secret store, and only its name goes
here.>
