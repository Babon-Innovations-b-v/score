"""Free counts of a remake's rows (#19: every scene inventory row through the prop pipeline): the unique models the
rows need, one take each, read from the environment's scene inventories alone (each place's current reading,
`current`). Nothing is judged or bought.

A row's model is its object kind (the row id with any trailing `_<n>`), the ratio of its sides (sorted, each over the
longest, bucketed in RATIO_STEP steps of log2, so a stool and a taller stool of the same build share one take while a
rod and a plate do not) and its kit (a kit group such as `kit: wall`, else none). Rows of one place with the same
model are one group: one take, drawn from the first row's concept crop (its place's concept picture, view and box).
The same model across places is counted apart (`across_places`): a place's style may differ, so sharing a take
across places is the owner's call, never assumed.

A shell piece (a wall, floor or ceiling kit piece, SHELL) takes its library surface with no maps (#21 cut 1), so its
route is shorter (estimate.py). A row that already reuses another place's take (`reuse`) needs no take of its own.
