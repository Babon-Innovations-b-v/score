"""MyoFullBody (MyoSuite's musculoskeletal body: its bones, 123 joints, 416 muscles and their tendons) made ready for
Newton and sized to one person (#65): `person_file` writes the person's file and returns its record.

The model is the pinned wheel the stage fetched (musclemimic_models 1.0.6, `SOURCE` in it). Each person's file is the
model with:
- its floor gone (the person stands on the scene's own ground);
- each bone group sized to the person's SOMA body (a limb's width by its girth), its masses from SOMA's volumes
  (`sizing`);
- each muscle's length range scaled by its path's length at the model's zero pose over the model's (OpenSim's
  muscle scaling: optimal fibre and tendon slack length with the path); its peak isometric force kept (#64: strength
  does not scale here); then its tendon slack length lengthened where it stands stretched (`resting`);
- #60's import fixes (`_fixes`): names without '-' or spaces, every muscle's full gain, bias and dynamics parameters,
  explicit inertials, a body with several joints split into 1 g wrapper bodies (one joint each), Euler written out.
