"""myo: the person's file written from a small body laid out as MyoFullBody's wheel has it (a floor, a body with two
joints, a muscle whose class gives its parameters, names with '-'), sized to a toy SOMA (each thigh and shin a box),
compiles in MuJoCo and builds in Newton with the
same joints, one joint a body, no '-' in a name, no floor, the person's mass, and every muscle's gain and bias in
Newton's model the published model's (#60's import fixes); with the fit's constants given, an inside joint's
body sits moved by its found move; the neck and head carry MyoHead's two joints, the torso the thoracic three, and the
girdle's coupling to the arm's elevation is gone, its joint on its own range, and its phantom follows it at -1
(`myo._movable`); a finger body laid at its joints' rest turns (`myo._rested`) stands at zero where it stood at those
turns and reaches every pose as before, its ranges moved by them; each foot turns on its shin about the shin's long
axis at the ankle, before the ankle's flexion, toes in for a positive turn on both sides, on `FEET`' ranges, and at
no twist stands as it did; each finger's MCP flexion bends back to `KNUCKLES`' extension, its flexion and every other
joint's range kept; each knee's shin turn (knee_angle_rotation3) leads on its published range, no longer set by the
flexion, the knee's other couplings kept (`KNEE`). It runs in Newton's own Python
(score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built there, as in `make
tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- person_file's `split(full_muscles(renamed(xml), final))` made `full_muscles(renamed(xml), final)`: a body keeps two
  joints.
- person_file's `split(full_muscles(renamed(xml), final))` made `split(full_muscles(xml, final))`: names keep '-'.
- person_file's `split(full_muscles(renamed(xml), final))` made `split(renamed(xml))`: the muscle's partial
  gainprm loses its class's range and Newton refuses it ("lmin<1<lmax required in muscle").
- person_file's `spec.delete(geom)` made `pass`: the floor stays.
- (2026-10-29) inside_moved's `body.pos = body.pos + joints[filed]` made `pass`: the talus stays where it was.
- (2026-10-31) _fresh's `movable(spec)` made `pass`: no neck or thoracic joint, the girdle still coupled.
- (2026-10-31) _girdle's `elif stem in PHANTOMS:` made `elif False:`: the phantom stays tied to shoulder_elv.
- (2026-11-01) rested's `_carried(joint, moves[index + 1:])` made `pass`: the first of two joints turns about its old
  axis, the tip lands 0.4 to 3.3 mm off.
- (2026-11-01) rested's `- turns[index]` made `- 0.0`: the range stays where it was.
- (2026-11-01) _feet's twist added after the ankle's flexion (the re-adding loop moved before it): the twist's axis
  tips with the foot's flexion, off the shin.
- (2026-11-01) _feet's `(-1.0 if side == "l" else 1.0)` made `1.0`: the left toes turn out for a positive twist.
- (2026-11-01) _knuckles' `joint.range = [...]` made `pass`: the MCP flexion stays at 0.
- (2026-11-01) KNUCKLES' stems made every `mcp{finger}_{turn}` (abduction too): the abduction's range moves.
- (2026-11-04) _knee's `spec.delete(equality)` made `pass`: the shin's turn stays tied to the flexion.
- (2026-11-04) _knee's `equality.name1[:-2] == follower and` dropped: the knee's sideways turn loses its coupling too.
