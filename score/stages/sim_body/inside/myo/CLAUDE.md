# score/stages/sim_body/inside/myo/

MyoFullBody made ready for Newton and sized to one person: `person_file` writes the person's file from the pinned
wheel (`SOURCE`), with the fit's constants when given (each joint inside a bone group moved, `inside_moved`; the markers'
moves stay in the fit; the lengths are the sizing's: the run
writes the file twice, sized, then fitted), and returns its record (scales, muscle length scale, kg) and each body's
scale. The run sizes a person once (`sized_body`, a `Sized`: the sized spec before and after the kneecaps'
fit) and writes both files from it (`written`, 2026-11-06, #70): the kneecaps' fit is the sizing's unless a constant
moves a body it reads (each kneecap's, tibia's and talus' own and every body above them), then fitted again on the
moved body; each file as `person_file`'s own sizing writes it (its test holds them equal). Its sizing is `sizing`'s; #60's import
fixes are `_fixes.py` (names without '-' or spaces, every muscle's full gain, bias and dynamics parameters, a body with
several joints split into 1 g wrappers, Euler written out, the floor gone).

- A fix here exists because Newton builds the file differently from MuJoCo's compile (#60): its test builds a small
  wheel-shaped body in both and holds them equal. A muscle whose name holds '-' is not written in full
  (`full_muscles` looks the renamed name up in the compile of the old names); MyoFullBody's muscle names have none.
- **MyoFullBody is made movable above the lower back** (#70, the owner: "MyoFullBody should be fully movable";
  `_movable.py`, on the spec of the pinned source, never the download): MyoHead's two neck joints the source leaves
  commented out, one three-axis thoracic joint at T12/L1, and the shoulder girdle's couplings to shoulder_elv dropped
  (the clavicle and the scapula lead), each with its literature range cited beside it; each MoBL phantom (unrotscap,
  unrothum) stays tied at -1 to the joint it undoes: left free, it shares that joint's axis and the clavicle's own
  turn has no target (the card's level 3 swung the pair bound to bound, 2026-10-31). A range is the anatomy's, never
  widened to pass a check.
- **Its feet turn as SOMA's do, within human ranges** (`_movable.FEET`, the owner, 2026-11-01): a twist hinge on the
  talus about the tibia's long axis (`ankle_rotation_{side}`, before the ankle's flexion, +: toes in), 25 degrees in
  and 20 out (the ankle complex's adduction and abduction; Lundberg 1989's 5 and 12 degrees under a 30-degree leg
  turn put the foot at that range's end on 57 % of mean's frames, standing ones too); the ankle to 55 degrees plantar flexion and 33
  dorsiflexion, the subtalar joint to 23 inversion (eversion the model's 20), each cited beside it. A clip that asks
  more (the seated clip's ~61 degrees pointed foot) is the clip's fault: never widened to follow it. Seed caches made
  before have two coordinates fewer and are refused by the card (`fit/_card/_solve`): make them again.
- **Its finger knuckles bend back as a person's do** (`_movable.KNUCKLES`, 2026-11-01): each finger's MCP flexion
  (mcp2 to mcp5) from 45 degrees of extension (the AAOS average range, cited beside it) to the model's 90 of flexion;
  the published 0 left the index and little distal phalanges outside SOMA's flatter hand. The thumb and every other
  joint keep their ranges.
- **Its shin turns on the femur of its own** (`_movable.KNEE`, 2026-11-04): knee_angle_rotation3's coupling to the
  flexion dropped (0.26 rad at 90 degrees, the range's end: seated the fitted shin stood 6 to 10 degrees from SOMA's
  Shin turn), the joint leading on the published model's own 15 degrees each way, inside a flexed knee's active 30
  medial and 40 lateral (Kapandji, cited beside it). The knee's other couplings stay.
- **Its spine, neck and single ranges are a person's** (#70, 2026-11-04; each cited beside it): the levels above L4
  (SOMA's Spine2) lead from L3/L4's own joints, the two above tied to them in the model's ratios (`LUMBAR`; White and
  Panjabi's levels move each on its own), L3/L4 on the model's own range; the lower neck flexes (40 degrees, 9.8 of
  extension: the whole neck with C0/C1's to Magee's 90 and 70) and bends sideways (45) at C7/T1, the neck turn's place
  (`CERVICAL`); the hip's rotation to 45 each way, the elbow to 145, the wrist to 70 each way and 30 of ulnar deviation,
  the toes to 40 each way (`RANGES`). The knee's 120 stays: its couplings are measured to 120 only.
- **Its held fingers rest in SOMA's hand** (`_rested.py`, 2026-11-01): each finger and thumb body turned by its
  joints' rest turns (`calibration.FINGERS`), so the file's zero pose, where `fit` holds the fingers, is SOMA's
  template hand's shape; each joint's axis and anchor carried so every pose is reached as before, its range moved by
  its turn. On the source's spec before sizing (one bone group, one scale); the muscles' length scale is read against
  the same rested source (`_fresh(source).compile()`), so a finger muscle's range does not scale by its rest turn.
- Its test runs in Newton's own Python by subprocess and prints `skipped` where no env is built.
