"""solvers: the bounded least squares, the least squares over a ball, the low-pass and the central differences each
give the answer worked out by hand (pure numpy and scipy: the score venv runs it).

Breaks (each applied once, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- least's line search `np.clip(x + size * step, lowest, highest)` made `x + size * step`: a bound is crossed.
- within_balls' projection `np.minimum(1.0, CAP_INSIDE / ...)` made `1.0`: the answer leaves its ball.
- smoothed's `filtfilt(...) if ... else moves` made `moves`: a 15 Hz shake at 30 frames a second goes through.
- stencils' `rate / (after - before)` made `rate`: a line's speed is doubled between its ends.
