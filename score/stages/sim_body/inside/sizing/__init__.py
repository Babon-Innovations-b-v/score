"""MyoFullBody sized to one person's SOMA body (#70: SOMA is the truth, its size included), `Size`:
- each bone group (`bone_groups.GROUPS`, trunk and pelvis included; a group with no body of its own, Neck2, is
  sized with the one before it on its chain: `stretches`) scaled evenly so its stretch (its two end joints: SOMA's
  rig joints at its bind, MyoFullBody's child bodies' joint anchors at its default pose) is SOMA's
  (`soma_lengths`, `myo_lengths`); all scales solved together (`Size.scales`), as a group's end may sit on another
  group's body; the pelvis, spanning two directions, also gets its width (`hip_width`: the hip joints apart);
- each group's mass, centre of mass and inertia's trace from SOMA's segment volumes (`volumes`: Dempster's densities),
  laid on the group's bodies (frames under FRAME_KG left out) in the model's own proportions, the centre carried
  into the group's frame by the calibration table and the inertias scaled together to the trace (`weigh`); the
  bodies of no group (the kneecaps, the abdominal wrapper) keep the model's share;
- each limb group's width (GIRTH_GROUPS; the two axes across its stretch) its length's scale times the person's girth
  for its length over SOMA's mean shape's (`volumes.slenderness`, MEAN_SLENDERNESS: MyoFullBody sized evenly is
  taken to fit the mean shape's girth, so a slimmer limb gets slimmer bones; `Size.widths`);
- each foot's width (FOOT_WIDTH) across its forefoot: the forefoot bone's axis across the foot scaled so its
  metatarsal heads stand as far apart across the foot as SOMA's on its skin (`forefoot_width`, `Size.fixed`), never
  by its length or girth;
- each kneecap left on MyoFullBody's own couplings to its knee, sized with its femur: refitted to lie inside SOMA's
  skin at every bend (#70, 2026-11-04 to 2026-11-07), it followed the linear-blend skin's cave at a bent knee and
  took the quadriceps' lever with it (#98: knee extension arm 1.1 to 1.4 cm at 60 to 75 degrees, MyoFullBody's own
  2.7 to 3.5; 13 cm at 120);
- what SOMA does not give marked as assumed with a plausible range (`assumed`).
A body's scale is three, one per axis of its own frame: its group's length scale along the axis nearest the group's
stretch at the default pose (`long_axes`), its width scale across (the same as the length's outside GIRTH_GROUPS); a
body of no group takes its parent's. A body's place in its parent scales with its parent, but OWN_PLACED's with its
own and JOINT_PLACED's about the centre it turns about on its parent (`joint_placed`). Positions, geoms, sites, joint anchors, meshes, inertias and a slide joint's coupling and range scale with it
(`sized`; a shape's or an inertia's axes, and a slide's, by the stretch along each, `_stretched`); each muscle's path length at the zero pose is read for
OpenSim's muscle scaling (`path_lengths`). The masses' centres stand at SOMA's own joints (`soma_point`,
`myo_point`): where a group's mass sits is not its length."""
