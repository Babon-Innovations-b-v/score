"""sizing: a small body built like MyoFullBody's legs and lower trunk (a pelvis, lumbar5 and lumbar3, each side's
femur, tibia, talus and toes), sized to a SOMA made of one thin box along each bone group's stretch, has every group's
stretch between its two end joints (the child bodies' joint anchors) SOMA's rig joints apart (the foot 1.5 times the
model's), every group's
mass its box's volume at Dempster's density (all brought to the person's mass with the bodies of no group kept), each
group's centre of mass on its stretch's middle and each one-body group's inertia its box's, each limb body as wide
across its long axis as its length scale times its box's width over its length over SOMA's mean shape's, each foot
across its forefoot as SOMA's metatarsal heads stand apart across it over the model's (0.06 over 0.08 m), and a box's
inertia under an uneven scale the scaled box's (all worked out by hand from the boxes); a toy neck placed by its centre on a scaled toy torso, that centre where the torso's scale puts it; and a body on its inertia's triangle edge (MyoFullBody's lumbar2) kept off it through a float32 round trip. It runs in Newton's own Python (MuJoCo pinned there; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh,
built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted):
- (2026-10-28) sized's `np.asarray(body.pos) * (scale if body.name in OWN_PLACED else above)` made
  `np.asarray(body.pos)`: no group grows.
- (2026-10-28) weigh's `shift = target - masses @ data.xipos[index] / mass` made `shift = np.zeros(3)`: the centres
  stay the model's.
- (2026-10-28) volumes.weighed's `density(group) * 1000.0 * volume` made `1000.0 * volume`: every density one.
- (2026-10-28) weigh's `max((trace - spread) / max(own, 1e-12), INERTIA_FLOOR)` made `1.0`: the inertias stay the
  model's.
- (2026-10-29) landmarks.marker's `+ np.asarray(row[5], dtype=float)` (the link) dropped: the foot sizes 1.513, not 1.5.
- (2026-10-29) soma_lengths' `soma_point(end, rig) - soma_point(start, rig)` made `soma_point(end, rig)`: each
  stretch sized to its end joint's distance from SOMA's origin, not its two joints apart.

- (2026-10-31) sizing.filled's cache dropped (`volumes.filled` called every time): the mesh is filled once per sizing.
- (2026-11-01) body_scales' `np.full(3, scales[owner[name]] * across)` made `np.full(3, scales[owner[name]])`: the
  limbs as wide as long.
- (2026-11-01) long_axes' `np.argmax(np.abs(local))` made `np.argmin(np.abs(local))`: the length laid across the
  bone, the foot sized along its width.
- (2026-11-01) _inertia's `* _stretched(scale, quat) ** 2` dropped: the box's inertia only by its mass.
- (2026-11-02) body_scales' `found[name][fixed[name][0]] = fixed[name][1]` dropped: the foot as wide as its girth asks,
  not as SOMA's forefoot.
- (2026-11-02) forefoot_width's `- along * (apart @ along)` dropped: the heads' plain distance apart (0.767, not 0.75).
- (2026-11-04) balanced's `inertia[largest] = most` dropped: lumbar2's A + B - C stays at 0 after float32.
- (2026-11-05) joint_placed's `parent_scale * in_parent` made `in_parent`: the neck's centre stays the source's place on
  a shrunk torso (the mean body's cervical bones 35 mm over its T1 at rest).
