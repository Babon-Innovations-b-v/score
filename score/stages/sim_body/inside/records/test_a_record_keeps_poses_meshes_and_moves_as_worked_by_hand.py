"""records: the record's pieces come out as worked by hand: a pose as place and quaternion, a segment's turn against
its parent in degrees, a mesh's near vertices merged with its flat faces dropped, RRA's `adjusted` record's pelvis
centimetres, least share and mass percent, the arrays named for the person, and a swaying quiet stance's pushes one a
foot, summing to its weight, each centre on the ground under its foot and none jumping frame to frame (`push_faults`,
on the solve's own pushes through `steadied`). It runs in Newton's own Python
(MuJoCo pinned there; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none
built there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- merged's flat-face filter `faces = faces[(faces[:, 0] != faces[:, 1]) & ...]` dropped: a face merged flat stays.
- adjustment_record's `pelvis = 100 * np.linalg.norm(moved_by, axis=1)` made `np.linalg.norm(moved_by, axis=1)`: the
  pelvis' move in metres, not centimetres.
- local_turns' `worlds[parent][:3, :3].T @ worlds[index][:3, :3]` made `worlds[index][:3, :3]`: a turn not against
  its parent.
2026-11-05:
- muscles.parts_of's `segment.removesuffix("ToeBase").removesuffix("Foot") + "Foot"` made `segment`: each toes' push
  is its own part, four arrows where two belong.
- muscles.touches' `sizes @ under / sizes.sum()` made `sizes @ under`: the centre is the push's newtons times the
  ground's points, metres off the ground and outside the foot.
- contact.pushes' `closeness(over[point]) * edge` made `edge`: a forefoot crossing GAP takes its whole share at once;
  steadied, a foot's push still jumps 2.5% of the weight and its centre 6.4 mm a frame (6.2% and 15.8 mm unsteadied).

- records.paths_of's `at[kept]` made `at`, contact.lowests' `heights[points]` made `heights`, local_turns'
  `above.transpose(0, 2, 1)` made `above`: each a one-pass piece no longer equal to the item-by-item one (2026-11-05).
