"""bone_groups: a `{Side}` name is written out for both sides, each segment rides its group's frame body, one of the
group's own bodies on its side, and every bone group spans the same joints as its SOMA segment: its SOMA stretch runs
from the segment's joint to that joint's child in SOMA's tree (SOMA_PARENTS: the template rig's, written out by hand),
each
SOMA joint is the same MyoFullBody centre in every group it ends or starts (and each centre one SOMA joint), every
body is in one group of its own side (pure: the score venv runs it).

Breaks (each applied once, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- _written's `side=side[0].lower()` made `side=side[0]`: LeftLeg's table writes `femur_L`, not `femur_l`.
- sided's `("Left", "Right")` made `("Left",)`: `{Side}Arm` is LeftArm only.
- GROUPS' Spine2 MyoFullBody start `"L3_L4"` made `"L2_L3"`: SOMA's Spine2 is two MyoFullBody centres.
- GROUPS' `{Side}Shin` SOMA end `"{Side}Foot"` made `"{Side}ToeBase"`: the shin's stretch skips a joint.
- GROUPS' `{Side}Foot` bodies `"talus_{side}"` made `"talus_l"`: the right foot holds a left body.
