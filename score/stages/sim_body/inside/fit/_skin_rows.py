the closest feature (the face's normal, an edge's plane, a corner's every axis), through the point's own
P (jacp - [r]x jacr) at its body (mj_jacBody; r the point off the body's origin). Mink's `fit._frames.SkinTask`

holds no skin rows (2026-11-01: they bent the person's constants 4 to 5 cm and its polish did not settle; the fit
