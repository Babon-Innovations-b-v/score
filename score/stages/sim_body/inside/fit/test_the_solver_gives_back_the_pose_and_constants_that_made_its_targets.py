"""fit: on a small model posed by hand (a free pelvis, a left leg of thigh and shin, a right leg whose ankle follows its
hip by a coupling, one thigh's calibration turned 30 degrees), with the person's constants set by hand (one pelvis
marker 1 cm off its link, the knee, a joint inside the left leg's group, 1 cm off its place), the solver gives back from
the bone groups' turns and the markers the marker's move (within its pull to its link) and the knee's (within its pull
to its place), and at those constants every frame's angles; a frame asking a hip past its range stops it at the range's
end, its coupled follower on its leader by the coupling, though the follower's own range is narrower; each marker weighs
its trust among the markers, the markers' goal (group ends included, one goal) MARKER_GOAL in all against the turns' 1;
a group end that is the middle of two bodies' centres (the hips') sits on their common holder (the pelvis) as one body's
sits on its own, one rule; the constants are the body's, sampled from every one of its recordings; SOMA's targets (its
segments' turns, its skin's landmarks and rig joints) leave both solves unchanged (#70: SOMA is never moved); a frame's
fit ends on a step that moves no task's error, though the step itself is not small; level 2 solves only the inside joint
axes its Jacobian can tell apart from the other unknowns (a pair fixed to the root: their common shift is the root's
place; a marked body welded under a markerless hinged middle: the hinge's own axis), and every other axis it keeps,
the other unknowns' span taken by their Gram matrix exactly as by the pivoted QR; the constants are found the same
with no card (CUDA hidden: mink's frames and scipy's solve, the conductor's way). It runs in Newton's own Python (mink
pinned there; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built there,
as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Level 1's skin residual (fit._skin.marks, depth_mm) is a bone point's distance to the skin's closest point when
outside, 0 inside, by the winding test; the region's root mean square. RRA's frame check (`FrameSkins`) marks each
frame's bone vertices against that frame's own posed skin.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted):
- (2026-11-01) _skin.apart_of's ring `face = ring_faces[slot]` made `face = found.face` (the float32 query's face
  alone): 9 of 600 depths off the nearest face's, by up to 1.31e-6 m
  (the_depth_is_the_nearest_faces_where_the_query_flips red).
- (2026-11-01) _skin.closest_on_triangle's edge `bend = _away(along)` made a zero matrix: the offsets' projectors 0.496
  off their central differences (the_depth_is_the_nearest_faces_where_the_query_flips red).
- (2026-11-01) _skin_rows' point rows `jacp - crossed(...) @ jacr` made `jacp + 0 * crossed(...) @ jacr` (the turn's
  lever dropped): a frame's fit does not converge in 300 steps (NotConverged).
- (2026-11-01) _skin_rows' `rows = bends @ moved` made `moved` (no projector): NotConverged, its last step 1.5e-5.
- (2026-11-01) _frames.SkinTask's objective `pull` made `-pull`: the bones 183.8 mm outside held against 7.07 mm free,
  the held frames' cost (turns, markers and skin rows) 170.2 over the free 0.25
  (the_frames_hold_the_bones_inside_the_skin red).
- (2026-11-01) _frames.Frames.fitted's fit without the skin dropped (its `self.frame(qpos, frame_turns,
  frame_points)` run only when `skins is None`): on the first frame, from the standing start the skin holds the shin
  bone in the other part's box, 153.6 mm outside its own skin, the knee 1.033 rad off its target (a_frame_is_not_held_in_another_parts_skin red).
- (2026-11-04) _frames.Frames.fitted's every frame fitted without the skin first made the first frame's only (the code
  before 2026-11-04): the frame after the swing held in the other part's box, the bone 189.1 mm outside its own skin,
  the knee 0.693 rad off (a_frame_is_not_held_in_another_parts_skin red).
- (2026-11-01) _skin.unfolded's `<= FOLD_MOST` made `<= 2.0`: the overlapping cubes' frame is kept and its point reads
  1 m deep (a_skin_folding_into_itself_gives_no_rows red).
- (2026-11-01) _skin.joined_faces' `| (parents[:, None] == joints[None, :]) | (joints[:, None] == parents[None, :])`
  dropped (each segment joined to itself alone): the parent and child cubes fold 0, not over 0.4; made every segment
  joined to every other: the sibling cubes fold 0.5 (a_skin_folding_into_itself_gives_no_rows red).
- (2026-11-01) _skin.apart_kernel's `if kept[mesh] != 0:` made `... or True`: the folded frame's point reads 1 m deep
  (a_skin_folding_into_itself_gives_no_rows red).
- (2026-11-05) _skin._blended's `weights[vert, segment] * moved` made `moved`: the card's skin metres off the CPU's;
  card_folded's `>= FOLD_OWN` made `> 2.0`: no frame folds on the card (a_skin_folding_into_itself_gives_no_rows red).
- (2026-11-01) PosedSkins.__getitem__ dropping `self.kept[frames]`: indexed skins read every frame kept.
- (2026-11-01) _skin.envelope's `for verts in pockets(rig):` made `pockets(rig)[:0]`, no pocket closed: the point in
  the cube's mouth reads outside the envelope (the_heads_pockets_are_closed_for_the_inside_test red).
- (2026-11-06) _skin.POCKET_REACH `0.08` made `0.03` (before): the 6 cm cavity stays open, its point reads outside
  (the_heads_pockets_are_closed_for_the_inside_test red).
- (2026-11-01) `_card/_measure.turn_errors`' default `table=cpu.judged_turn` made `frozen_turn`, or
  `evaluation._measure.judged_turn` returning `frozen_turn`: level 1 scores the turns on main's frozen table while
  the stage's follows targets ride the table read again from the moved centres.
- (2026-11-03) posed_paths' `card_paths if on_card() else mink_paths` made `card_paths`: with the card hidden the
  solve raises "Invalid device identifier: cuda:0" (the conductor's fault; the_solver_gives_back_the_angles_and_the_
  constants (no card) red). constants_on's `wide=card` made `wide=True` stays green: level 2's card solve
  (`_card._level2_lm`, `_level2_wide`) runs on Warp's default device, the CPU with no card.
- (2026-11-06) _card._level3.angles' settle rule `still[final - 1 - frames[0]]` made `True` (every frame final
  after one sweep, its seed the chain's, not the frame before's answer): 1 sweep over 17 frames; the skin pass
  dropped from `_level3.sweep` (`return free`): angles 0.502 deg, sites 10.1 mm, bones 10.0 mm off mink's
  (level_3_on_the_card_is_minks_frames red). The toy has one minimum a frame, so a sweep seeded from each frame's own
  last answer, or a chain from the start every time, stays green: the recurrence's history is the real bodies'
  measure (the shoulder's flat elevation-plane valley), not this check's.
- (2026-11-06) _card._level3.sweep's fit without the skin `exact=True` dropped (Newton's float32-built joint places
  read again): "2 of level 3's solves read Newton's joint places"; _forward.Exact's body places rounded to float32:
  the card's frames 9.35e-09 off MuJoCo's; _solve.solved's `exact.drive(optimizer)` dropped: "0 of level 3's 4
  solves on MuJoCo's twists"; _forward._subspace's hinge `cross(anchor, axis)` made `cross(axis, anchor)`: the twists
  2.51 off, the card 62.97 deg off mink (level_3_on_the_card_reads_minks_own_model_at_the_shoulder red). The toy's
  angles and sites stay within the gate either way (sites 0.0002 mm on Newton's places, 0.0003 on MuJoCo's): its
  chain is too short for float32's rounding to reach 0.01 mm, mean's jump showed 0.024 mm.
- (2026-10-28) Fitting's site `Rotation.from_matrix(calibration.T)` made `Rotation.from_matrix(calibration)`: the turned
  thigh's target is met by a wrong pose.
- (2026-10-28) limited_model's `found.jnt_limited[self.followers] = 0` dropped: the follower's own range stops its
  leader short.
- (2026-10-30) _card._clip.for_fitting's `moved_inside(builder, fitting)` dropped: Newton poses the knee where the
  file has it, not where the fit moved it, and the card's sampled frames are refused, sites 10.0000 mm off MuJoCo's.
- (2026-10-30) card_paths' `for fit in fits` made `for fit in fits[:1] * len(fits)`: every set posed on set 0's
  model, the second set 0.003047 rad off its card_path alone.
- (2026-10-30) constants_across's `zip(fits, sampled_sets, paths)` made `zip(fits, sampled_sets, paths[::-1])`: each
  set solved on the other's frames, 2.3e-7 m off its constants alone (green 3.9e-8: the card's float32 frames;
  a thin margin, the toy's two sets' frames differ little).
- (2026-10-28) Frames' constraints `[mink.EqualityConstraintTask(...)]` made `[]`: the follower leaves its leader.
- (2026-10-29) Fitting.apply's `self.model.site_pos[self.mark_sites] += marks` dropped: the marker's move is not found.
- (2026-10-29) _frames.weights' `np.sqrt(trusts / max(trusts.sum(), 1e-12))` made `np.full(len(trusts), 1.0 /
  np.sqrt(len(trusts)))`: the low-trust marker weighs as much as the others.
- (2026-10-29) _frames.weights' `trusts.sum()` made `trusts[:-1].sum()`: a group end weighs on top of the markers' goal,
  not inside it.
- (2026-10-29) _frames.weights' `fitting.marker_goal * trusts` made `2 * trusts`: the markers' goal outweighs the turns'.
- (2026-10-30) _frames.weights' `fitting.marker_goal` made the module's `MARKER_GOAL`: a set solved across others weighs
  its markers by the last set's goal (the_place_goal_sums_to_the_marker_goal red).
- (2026-10-29) sampled's `for turns, points in recordings` made `for turns, points in recordings[:1]`: the body's second
  recording is left out of its constants.
- (2026-10-29) Fitting.apply's `self.model.body_pos[self.inside] += joints` dropped: the knee's move is not found.
- (2026-10-29) angles' `Frames(fit).fitted(turns, points)` after `points[...] = points + 0.0`: SOMA's targets are moved
  by the solve.
- (2026-10-29) end_site's holder `next(body for body in _above(...) if all(...))` made `bodies[0]`: the hips' middle
  rides the left thigh.
- (2026-10-31) end_site's `holder = _between(model, holder, bodies)` dropped: the hip and knee's middle rides the
  pelvis, not the thigh moving between them.
- (2026-10-29) _frames.solved's `or moved < STEP_DONE` dropped: the hinge whose mass sits 1e-6 m off its axis drifts
  1e-3 rad a step and raises NotConverged.
- (2026-10-29) _constants.told's kept `np.abs(np.diag(upper)) >= TOLD` made `>= 0`: every inside axis is solved, the
  pair's common shift and the hinge's axis among them.
- (2026-10-31) _skin.marks' mesh built without `support_winding_number=True`: Warp's sign query misjudges points
  of a skin that crosses itself (four overlapping spheres: 7 to 143 of 4,000 points on the wrong side).
- (2026-10-31) _constants.told's QR pivoted again (`pivoting=True`, kept by its order): of the pair's two bodies the
  one whose marks' trust is doubled is kept (on tall a 5 % change flipped humphant_l's y and humphant1_l's, level 2's
  constants a centimetre apart between level 1's nudged sets).
- (2026-10-29) _constants.off_span's `scaled.T @ columns` made `scaled.T @ columns * 0.5`: the Gram path's projection
  is not the QR's.
- (2026-10-30) _skin.marks_kernel's depth `warp.where(found.sign >= 0.0, ..., 0.0)` made the distance alone: a point
  inside the skin counts 0.8 m deep.
- (2026-10-30) _constants.staged's ftol/xtol/gtol made scipy's defaults (1e-8): level 2 stops on the cost's change at
  4.79e-5 of its start's gradient (settled 1.26e-5).
- (2026-10-30) _constants.steadied's `< np.abs(gradient).max()` made `> np.abs(gradient).max()`: the step that lowers
  the free gradient is refused and the one turned back taken (mean_kimodo's polish stood at 1.59e-10 with no
  gradient test).
- (2026-10-30) _constants.descended's `< cost` made `<= cost`: a step the cost cannot see is taken by `descended`
  and never judged by `steadied` (heavy_kimodo's polish stood at 1.48e-10 for its last 10 rounds, halvings 1e-13 long).

- (2026-10-31) _constants.polished's `lowest < FLOOR` made `lowest < np.inf`: a polish stalled far from settled is
  taken as settled.
- (2026-11-01) shifted_end's `local - turn.T @ ...` made `local + turn.T @ ...`: SOMA's joint pulls the bones the
  shift's way twice over, not off it (an_end_read_in_the_skin_holds_its_bones_off_somas_joint red).
- (2026-11-01) shifted_end's `turn.T @ (TO_OWN.T @ shift)` made `turn.T @ shift`: the shift taken in MuJoCo's frame,
  not the person's (Y up), the bones held off sideways.
- (2026-11-05) FrameSkins.outside's meshes `[mesh.id for mesh in self.meshes]` made the first frame's for every frame:
  each frame's bones judged against one frame's skin (a_frames_skin_marks_the_bones_out_of_it_frame_by_frame red).
- (2026-11-05) _frames.SkinTask.set_skin's `self.seen = {}` dropped: a new skin at the same pose reads the last
  skin's measure (a_pose_measured_once_gives_the_same_fit red).
- (2026-11-05) _frames.SkinTask._apart's key `placed.tobytes()` made `placed.round(2).tobytes()`: nearby poses read
  one another's measure, the angles off measuring every ask (a_pose_measured_once_gives_the_same_fit red).
