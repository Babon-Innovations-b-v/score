"""Level 3 on the card, every frame at once (#70 speed, 2026-11-06): mink's frames (`../_frames.Frames.fitted`) are a
recurrence, each frame's fit without the skin from the frame before's fit with it, then its fit with the skin from
that; this solves the same recurrence in sweeps of the card loop (`_clip.Clip.angles`), every frame not yet final one
row, so its answer is the recurrence's, not each frame's own minimum.

A sweep seeds each frame's fit without the skin from the frame before's last answer (the first frame from mink's own
`start`), then its fit with the skin from that. A frame is final once the frame before is final and moved under
SETTLED_TURN / SETTLED_PLACE between the sweep that seeded it and the one after (its seed is then the final one, to
that tolerance); the first frame not final is final after the next sweep by construction (its seed final), so the
sweeps end in at most one per frame, the later ones over the frames not final only. The first sweep's seeds are a
chain without the skin every STRIDE-th frame (each from the one before, one row a solve), each frame from the chain's
frame at or before it: never a cold rest pose, which may land in another minimum."""
