"""MyoFullBody fitted to the clip's SOMA body (#70: SOMA is the truth), one solver: the person's constants (where each
landmark's marker sits on its bone and each joint inside a bone group sits in its parent; the lengths are SOMA's, from
the sizing) and every frame's joint angles, against one cost of the bone groups' turns (the main term: each SOMA segment's world turn on its group's
calibration site, OpenSense's orientation tracking with the static table, never a fitted offset) and the landmarks'
markers (SCORE's landmark set on the clip's own skin, each weighed by its trust, and SOMA's rig joint at each bone
group's start, `group_ends`), weighed as OpenSim's IK weighs its goals; SOMA's joints are also the measure
(`following`), within the joints' ranges and with the model's couplings held.

- `targets`: the clip's targets in MuJoCo's frame: each group's segment turn, each solver landmark skinned, SOMA's
  skin posed on every frame (`_skin.PosedSkins`: level 3 holds the bones inside it, #70 2026-11-01).
- `constants`: on SAMPLE frames spread over all the body's recordings (Cotton et al. 2026, arXiv:2608.29928, the
  idea only): the whole body placed and posed by mink at the sizing's lengths (`_frames`), then the poses with the
  markers' moves and the joints inside the groups, scipy's bounded `least_squares` over those constants and the
  frames' angles together, warm from mink's (`_constants`).
- `angles`: mink on every frame of the clip, on the person's file written with the found constants (`LEVEL3_CARD`:
  every frame at once on the card, `_card._level3`).
- `following` and `riding` (`_follow`): the judgement (joint mm, group degrees, at a range limit or not) and where each
  SOMA segment rides its group's frame body.
Nothing here moves, scales or grounds SOMA: the run writes no SOMA pose, and MyoFullBody's root follows the markers on
SOMA's skin."""
