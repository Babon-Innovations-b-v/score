"""Each muscle's tendon slack length calibrated at the standing pose (#70, the owner's option 3 of 2026-10-29: "Adjust
the tendon lengths so the stomach muscles aren't stretched while standing"): a muscle whose fibre stands longer than
REST_MOST of its optimal length at MyoSuite's `stand` (the zero pose, couplings applied) has its tendon slack length
lengthened so it stands at REST_MOST; its optimal fibre length, peak force and curves are kept.

MuJoCo's muscle has no tendon slack length of its own: its optimal fibre length is L0 = (lr1 - lr0) / (range1 - range0)
and its tendon slack length LT = lr0 - range0 L0, both from its `lengthrange` (lr0, lr1) and `range` (gainprm[0:2]).
Moving both ends of the length range by the same distance keeps L0 and moves LT by that distance alone. LT is solved
from the musculotendon length in a reference pose and the optimal fibre length, the fibre's normalised length there
given: a one-pose form of Manal and Buchanan 2004's numerical method (J Appl Biomech 20(2):195-203,
doi:10.1123/jab.20.2.195, which takes two poses); the optimal fibre lengths are not touched: MyoFullBody's own LT is below
zero for 32 of the 74 muscles over REST_MOST standing (MyoConverter fits the curves, not the lengths), and keeping LT +
L0 would need a slack length below zero for 46 of them (rectus abdominis: L0 3.9 times its own, measured 2026-10-29)."""
