"""contact: the ground pushes the person's skin (`Skin`, carried by the body's bones) only where it comes within GAP
of the drawn ground, whichever drawn surface that is (a seat as a floor), inside a friction pyramid when slow and
sliding against its slip when fast, a point blended over two bodies moving with both by its weights, its push's
directions as long as it is near, so a point's push fades to nothing at GAP (worked by hand); every state's pushes at
once (`pushes_all`, the card's) are each state's own, and so are the balance's touching points (`touching_all`);
a back the skin leans on within GAP pushes it along the back's normal, the same in all three.
It runs in Newton's own Python (MuJoCo pinned there; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at
$PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- pushes' `<= GAP` made `<= 1.0`: a ball 6 mm over the ground is pushed.
- pushes' `np.linalg.norm(moving) > SLIDE_MOST` made `< SLIDE_MOST`: a slow point slides and a fast one sticks.
2026-11-01:
- pushes' `own` made the colliders' points (`surface(model, data, range(model.ngeom)) @ TO_OWN.T`, the contact before
  the skin): the ball's 3 cm collider stands 24 mm over its seat inside its 5 cm skin, and nothing is pushed.
- Skin.jacobian's `found += self.weights[point, segment] * along` made `found += along`: the half-and-half point
  moves as fast as the ball.
2026-11-05:
- pushes_all's `motion *= chains.moves[...]` dropped: a point on the world is moved by the ball's dofs.
- Chains' `dof = model.dof_parentid[dof]` made `dof -= 1`: a chain runs through dofs that are not the body's.
- pushes' `closeness(over[point]) * edge` made `edge`: the point 4 mm over is pushed as freely as one on the ground,
  so a point crossing GAP takes its whole share at once (a foot's centre of pressure 3 to 6 cm a frame).
2026-11-06:
- touching_all's `speed[:, 3:] + np.cross(...)` made `speed[:, 3:]`: the rolling ball's lowest point read at its
  centre's 1 m/s, so it sticks on a pyramid where its push slides.
- pyramids' `edges[sliding, 0] = ...` dropped: a sliding point keeps its pyramid's first edge.
2026-11-07 (#98):
- pushes' `over = over - skin.credit[...]` dropped: the foot seen standing 20 mm up is not pushed.
- credited's `<= STANCE_HIGH` made `<= 1.0`: the foot 60 mm up is pushed from its sole.
- pushes_all's `- credit[state]` dropped: its state differs from `pushes`'.
- kabsch's `middle_wanted - turn @ middle_given` made `middle_wanted - middle_given`: the registered riding is off.
2026-11-14:
- pushes' backs dropped (`leaned(...)[:0]`): the ball 3 mm off the upright back is pushed by nothing, as cockpit's
  pilot's chest on his seat's back was; pushes_all's backs dropped: its state differs from `pushes`'; touching_all's
  backs dropped: the balance's state differs.
