"""ground: a point stands on the highest drawn triangle under it at most REACH_UP (the cast's KNEE) over it, a body's
points over its lowest point, with HEADROOM free over it, at the height worked out by hand, and every triangle's
normal points up (pure numpy: the score venv runs it).

Breaks (each applied once, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28, 2026-10-30 and 2026-10-31:
- standing's `free = (above - heights >= HEADROOM) & ...` made `>= 0`: a point 1.1 m over a floor, over a counter
  top at 1.0 m with a cupboard 0.5 m over it, stands on the counter top, under the cupboard.
- standing's `top = which != np.append(which[1:], -1)` made the first of each point (the lowest, as before
  2026-10-30): a point on a deck 2.958 m over a floor stands on the floor, the deck read as its roof (greenhouse's
  astronauts on Structure/deck_2).
- standing's `& (heights <= points[which, 1] + REACH_UP)` dropped: a point on the floor under the deck stands on the
  deck.
- standing's `reach = points[:, 1] + REACH_UP if reach is None else ...` made to ignore `reach` (each point its own
  reach, as 75903a1a left it, 2026-10-31): a 1.76 m body under a roof at 1.84 m reads 0.24 m into its ground, its
  head grounded on the roof (tube's person_mid_left_2, greenhouse's astronauts 1, 4 and 5).
- REACH_UP made 0.4: it no longer agrees with the cast's KNEE.
- normals' `found *= np.sign(found[:, 1:2]) + (found[:, 1:2] == 0)` dropped: a triangle wound the other way points
  down.
