"""muscles: a body standing still on a flat ground under gravity is carried by the ground: the static optimisation
gives the ground's push its weight and leaves almost no residual on the pelvis, the movement's needed force is its
weight up, and the touching part's push (`touches`, the ball's body by its name) is that whole push, at the ground under
it; and the static optimisation is well-posed: a muscle has no moment on the root's free joint, so the card's float32
rounding there (1e-3, MuJoCo's C 1e-11) moves no activation, and a 1e-6 nudge of the moments moves them by about 1e-6;
and on the ground too, the ground reaction force solved first (`staged`): two feet on a flat floor asked for a
moment past their toes (the body cannot be balanced, so the balance sits on the edge of the contacts' cone, its toe
points' friction pyramids dependent), a 1e-6 nudge of the contact columns moves the activations under 1e-5 and each
foot carries half the weight.
It runs in Newton's own Python (on a model Newton builds; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh,
built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- shared's `rows[:6] = BALANCE` made `rows[:6] = 0.0`: the pelvis' balance costs nothing, so the ground pushes
  nothing and the weight is left as residual.
- needed's `found + model.dof_armature * qacc - data.qfrc_passive` made `-found + ...`: the movement asks for its
  weight down.
2026-11-04:
- touches' `centre = sizes @ ...` made `centre = np.zeros(3) + 1.0`: the push stands off the ground under the ball.
2026-11-05:
- touches' `normals = np.divide(normals, lengths, ...)` dropped: the push along its normals reads 3.2 times the push
  (the pyramid's four edges, each `closeness` 0.8 long 1 mm over, summed).
- problem's `arms[root dofs] = 0.0` made `pass`: the muscles' columns stand on the root's rows, and given the card's
  1e-3 of moment there the airborne leg's holding muscle goes from 0.150 to 0.0, pulled to cancel the pelvis'
  residual it cannot touch (2026-11-05, #70: the jump's frame 30, mean 0.115 on MuJoCo's C, 0.206 on the card).
- staged's steps made the one least squares of before (contacts, stops and muscles together, the pelvis' rows
  BALANCE): a 1e-6 nudge of the contacts moves an ankle muscle by 0.145.
- share_asked's SHARE_COST made CONTACT_COST: the nudge moves it by 0.0028 (the balance crowded on a few points).
