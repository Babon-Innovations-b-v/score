"""SOMA's segment volumes and the masses, centres of mass and inertias they give (#70; pure numpy): the person's closed
mesh at its bind filled with cells (`filled`), each cell given to the bone group whose SOMA stretch is nearest
(`shares`), each group's volume, centre and spread (`measured`), and its mass, centre of mass and inertia's trace at
Dempster's segment densities, all brought to the person's mass (`weighed`).

Motion cannot tell weight, so the masses come from the body's shape (the owner's design, #70). The densities are
assumed: Dempster 1955 (WADC TR 55-159, eight cadavers aged 52 to 83) as Winter 2009 tabulates them (Biomechanics and
Motor Control of Human Movement, Table 4.1), the same for every person; Chandler et al. 1975 measured lower ones (upper
arm 0.997 against 1.07 kg/l, forearm 1.043 against 1.13, hand 1.079 against 1.16, thigh 1.018 against 1.05), so a
segment's own may be some 7% under them (`DENSITY_RANGE`)."""
