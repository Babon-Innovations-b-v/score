"""motor: the whole trial's spline solve (MOTOR step 1) on the card's toy (`fit/_card/tests/card_toy.py`: a free root,
three ranged hinges, a polyval follower, a frozen hinge) over a 40-frame clip whose places are 2 mm off and one hinge
driven past its range: the spline's nodes are the values it was fitted to and its banded step the dense one; the
frames' cost carried onto the unknowns (the root's place and body-frame rotation vector included) has the gradient of
the frames' cost by central differences; and the solve, warm started from level 3's per-frame fit, lowers the whole
cost (frames and jerk), shakes less than the fit, and keeps every hinge's spline inside its range (the
projection never moves a joint off it). It runs in Newton's own
Python on a card (score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none built
there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-11-08:
- `Layout.carried`'s `twist[:3, 3:] = skew(qpos[frame, :3]) @ spun` dropped: the root's turn columns lose the
  place's swing, and the differences' check is red.
- `Layout.carried`'s `right_jacobian(...)` made `np.eye(3)`: red at the rotated pose's root turn columns.
- `_spline.Banded.add_nodes`' `NODE[first] * NODE[second]` made `NODE[first]`: the banded system is no longer
  positive definite (solveh_banded raises).
- `Layout`'s bounds made unbounded (`self.lower[self.joints] = -np.inf` and the upper `np.inf` after the root's):
  h1's spline leaves its range and the projection clips it off the spline.

Step 2 (stage A) on the same toy, built as a person is (`model.built`) with a skin grid under its root on a flat
floor: the contact's force derivatives against central differences, rows spread on a node's control points against
the dense normal equations, the nodes' speeds against their poses' central differences, a slow node's dynamics
Jacobian within 10% of its torques' central differences, and the solve taking the worst frame's residual to under
half of step 1's. Breaks, 2026-11-08, each seen red and reverted:
- `_dynamics.push`'s `deep_over` sign flipped: the contact's derivative and the node's Jacobian are red.
- `Dynamics.jacobians`' mass matrix dropped (`by_pace` 0): the node's Jacobian is 1.0 of its differences off.
- `_spline.Banded.add_rows`' blocks J_b^T J_a made J_a^T J_b: the spread rows' step is red.
- `_stage_a.Weighed.residuals` negated: no step is kept and the residual stays at step 1's.

Step 3's pieces on the same toy: the couplings and the place nudge on all rows at once against `model.Couplings` and
MuJoCo's `mj_integratePos` row by row, the warm start lowered 1 cm settled out of its floor, a learned landmark
weight keeping the markers' goal, a settings name not known refused, every landmark's miss recorded. Breaks,
2026-11-08, each seen red and reverted:
- `_dynamics.integrated`'s turn `q * exp(w)` made `exp(w) * q`: the nudge 3.3e-2 off mj_integratePos.
- `_dynamics.Coupled.maps`' `moved ** (power - 1)` made `moved ** power`: not the couplings' map.
- `_dynamics.Contact.settle`'s sunk made 0: the lowered skin stays 2.8 cm inside its floor.
- `motor.retrusted`'s `costs ** 2 * weights` made `costs ** 2`: the weight 4 changes nothing.

Step 4 (stage B) on the same toy with five muscles (`muscled`): MuJoCo's muscle curves in Warp against
`mju_muscleGain` / `mju_muscleBias` and their tape derivatives against differences, the muscles' torques against
MuJoCo's own actuator forces, the excitations against `mju_muscleDynamics`, the speed Jacobian of the muscle torques,
the activations' elimination against the dense normal equations, the cost's slope along the activations' step, the
reserves' stop weights' slope, the pelvis' rows along a short step within 0.3 of their linear model, and the solve
lowering its cost from its warm start, its worst reserve and residual no higher. Breaks, 2026-11-08, each seen red
and reverted:
- `_muscles._curves`' force-velocity `(speed + one) * (speed + one)` made `(speed + one)`: the gain and the torques
  are off MuJoCo's.
- `_stage_b.Muscled.muscle_part`'s forces without the passive bias: the torques 0.37 off MuJoCo's.
- `_muscles.excitations`' `- constant / step` made `+`: the first node's derivative 3.5 off.
- `_stage_b.Solve.eliminated`'s Woodbury `first - ...` made `first + ...`: the step's solve raises.
- `_dynamics.Dynamics.jacobians` on the damping alone for stage B: the pelvis' rows 1.26 off their model, and the
  worst residual over stage A's.
- `_stage_b.stop_shares`' slope's sign flipped: the stop weights' slope off its differences.
