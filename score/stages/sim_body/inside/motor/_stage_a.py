"""MOTOR step 2 (#98), stage A: the whole trial's movement, contact and joint torques as one solve.

Warm started at step 1's spline (the fit's cost over the whole trial, `motor.solved_on`), the same unknowns take the
dynamics' rows (`_dynamics`): the pelvis' six residual rows (force over the weight, moment over weight x the centre's
standing height) held by an augmented Lagrangian (rows sqrt(rho / 2) (c + lambda / rho), lambda += rho c after each
inner solve, rho raised PENALTY_RAISE times when the worst frame did not fall to PROGRESS of the round before) until
every frame is within the stage's residual limits (2 %BW, 1 %BW*ht), and the joints' torques as an effort (rows
sqrt(w) tau / (weight x height)). Inner solve: Levenberg-Marquardt on the banded normal equations (`_spline.Banded`),
the dynamics' Jacobians taken again only at a kept step (a refused one costs the cost alone).

The penalty starts where a frame whose residual force stands at its limit weighs what a frame's fit costs at the warm
start (started where the warm start's whole residual weighed the fit's, a 100 %BW residual left it at 1e-2 and six
rounds ended 34 times over the limit, 2026-11-08), and the effort at the settings' effort share of the fit's cost:
scales, not weights fitted to anything (step 3 tunes the share and the contact's settings, `_dynamics.Settings`, on
subjects 2-5 against the plates; never against the lab's angles). Before the first round the contact is settled at
the warm start (`Contact.settle`): no body starts inside its ground."""
