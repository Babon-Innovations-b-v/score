"""MOTOR (#98), step 1: the whole trial's movement as one solve on the card, warm started from the fit.

The fit (`fit.angles`) solves every frame alone and the chain then low-passes the path (`model.filtered`, CUTOFF);
here every leading coordinate's path over the whole trial is one uniform cubic B-spline (`_spline`), and one
Levenberg-Marquardt solve over all their control points at once minimises the fit's own cost summed over the frames
(the groups' turns, the landmarks' markers, the bones held inside SOMA's posed skin: `_rows`, level 3's residuals on
the card) plus the spline's jerk, the leading joints inside their ranges by box bounds on their control points (a
B-spline stays inside the hull of its control points). The root's place is a spline like a joint's; its turn is the
fit's turn low-passed (`smooth_turns`) times the exponential of a spline of rotation vectors in the body's frame.

The jerk's weight a coordinate is not tuned: it is the one that puts the solve's own smoothing at the chain's cutoff
(`jerk_weights`): a node's data stiffness a (its Gauss-Newton diagonal at the warm start, the frames' median) against
a jerk weight w smooths a path as 1 / (1 + (w step / a) (2 pi f)^6), half at w = a / (step (2 pi CUTOFF)^6), where
the chain's Butterworth run forward and back is half too.

`solved(fitting, turns, points, skins, angles, rate)` gives (every frame's angles [N, nq] in the fitting model's
layout, the record, the motion: its problem and control points, step 2's warm start). `dynamics_solved` is step 2's
stage A on it (`_stage_a`: inverse dynamics, contact and the pelvis' residual as rows of the same solve);
`muscles_solved` step 4's stage B on stage A's answer (`_stage_b`: the muscles' activations solved with the movement). Card only: it raises where Warp sees no CUDA card."""
