"""MOTOR step 2 (#98), stage A's dynamics rows: every frame's inverse dynamics on the card, a smooth contact on the
seen floor, the pelvis' residual and the joints' torques, as rows of the whole trial's spline solve.

The spline's unknowns (`motor.Layout`: each leading coordinate, the root's place and its body-frame rotation vector
on the fit's low-passed turn) give every node a pose, speed and acceleration (`Path.states`: the spline's own
derivatives, the poses a quarter step either side by its second-order Taylor series, the reference turn's own
turning included, MuJoCo's `mj_differentiatePos` of them; followers set by the person's couplings). The card gives
the forces each node needs (`batched.Card.evaluate`: rne + armature x qacc - passive), the contact (`Contact`) what
the ground gives: each skin point within BAND of its ground (its height measured from the seen floor: the job's
stance credit, `contact.Skin.credited`) pushed by a smooth Hunt-Crossley spring and damper with a smoothed Coulomb
friction, as OpenCap's tracking simulation's contact (Serrancoli et al. 2019; its dissipation and friction), a force
of the motion alone (no force unknowns, no per-frame assignment). On the leading coordinates (the couplings' map G):
tau = G^T (needed - J_c^T f_c); its root's six rows are the pelvis' residual (constrained by the augmented
Lagrangian in `motor.dynamics_solved`), the rest the joints' torques (the effort).

The rows' Jacobians on a node's place, speed and acceleration: the needed forces' on the place by one-sided
differences on the card (`PLACE_STEP`, every frame's every unknown at once), on the acceleration the mass matrix
(MuJoCo's `mj_fullM`, exact: they are linear in it) and on the speed the joints' damping (the velocity product terms
left out: a Gauss-Newton model, the cost itself always exact); the contact's analytic through each point's Jacobian.

Card only: the needed forces are the card's (`Physics.card`)."""
