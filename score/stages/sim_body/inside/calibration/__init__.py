"""The static calibration table (#70; pure numpy): for each bone group, the fixed turn between SOMA's segment frame
and MyoFullBody's group frame (`turn`), so the group's body turns as R_body = R_segment @ R_cal. It is read once from
the two models' rest poses, SOMA's rest skeleton (its template rig's bind) against MyoFullBody's default pose (its
couplings applied: MyoSuite's `stand`), the same for every person and every clip, never fitted, so it cannot absorb a
person's posture such as a curved spine. `_measure.py` (Newton's Python) measures it again and prints `TABLE`.

`aligned` is the maths: each rest's anatomical axes (columns: the long axis, from the stretch's start to its end, the
reference axis crossed with it, and the reference axis made square to it; `frame`), in SOMA's segment frame (a_s)
and in the group body's frame (a_m), R_cal = a_s a_m^T: the body frame in the segment frame when the two rests' bones
lie along each other. The long axis runs between the group's two end joints, the same ends sizing measures (SOMA's
rig joints, MyoFullBody's joint centres). The reference fixes the twist about the bone (`REFERENCES`), from the same
landmarks on both models (since 2026-10-29, #70; before, SOMA's bind z of the forearm and shin and MyoFullBody's elbow
and knee axes, which left the upper arm turned about 9 degrees on every body): the humerus' epicondyles for upper arm
and forearm (the ulna's flexion axis: SOMA's forearm does not pronate), the femur's for the thigh, the malleoli for
the shin, MC5 head to MC2 head for the hand, MT1 head to MT5 head for the foot and toes (since 2026-11-04); the
person's own x (left) for the trunk, own y (up) for the shoulder. The toes' hinge's two groups (`HINGED`) keep the reference
exact and square their long axis to it; the lumbar pair takes the whole lumbar's line (`LONG_LINES`); the feet are
then levelled about their hinge so a flat rest foot is a flat rest foot (`LEVELLED`).

Against taking SOMA's rest as MyoFullBody's default literally, it differs by the two rests' posture (measured
2026-10-28): the arms 48 degrees (SOMA's A-pose), toes 26, shin 12.6, shoulder 12, Spine2 12, Spine1 9.6, head 6.7,
hips 6.1, thigh 5.3, foot 7.2, chest 3.6. SOMA's bind has its knees bent about 15 degrees."""
