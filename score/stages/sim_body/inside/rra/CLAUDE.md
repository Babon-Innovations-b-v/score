# score/stages/sim_body/inside/rra/

OpenSim's residual reduction (RRA, the parent overlay): `reweighed` (RRATool's mass and torso centre of mass step),
`reduced` (the pelvis' and trunk's capped, low-passed move), `within_follows`, `within_frames`, and the measures the
`adjusted` record reads (`turned_off`, `off_clip`); `_linear.py` holds what a state asks of the body and its
linearisation, `_cap.py` the caps, `_footed.py` `Footing` (the feet kept where they stood by the legs: mink per frame,
set up as the fit's and through its `fit.solved`, a frame not converged fails the run; the handwritten damped least
squares it replaced, 40 fixed steps with ranges by clipping, went 2026-10-29: one solver in sim_body).

- Moved unchanged in #70's split; changed since by #70 only where its review asked (2026-10-29): the mass step bounded
  (`MASS_MOST`) and `Footing` on mink; the torso's centre of mass moved only across its own mean up (`level`,
  2026-11-09, #98), as RRATool moves it in its body's x and z: fitted in all three axes, the vertical one read off the
  frames' small tilts alone and 98% of LabValidation's 715 runs took it to the 10 cm cap (median move 15.5 cm).
- `Footing` holds each moving leg joint in its range, or where the frame it puts the feet back to (`before`, the
  fitted path) already stands past a stop, within where it stands (2026-11-03, #70): camp's walking astronaut_1, its
  right knee carried 0.38 degrees past its 0 stop by the path's low-pass on 27 of 150 frames, had that knee pulled
  in at no move, the hip turned 18 degrees to keep the foot, so `within_frames` found those frames 3.55 times the cap
  with every share at 0 and failed the run. The cap and the follows limit are unchanged.
- Its test runs in Newton's own Python by subprocess and prints `skipped` where no env is built.
- On a CUDA card (2026-11-05, #70) `Footing` given the person's file solves every frame at once there
  (`_footed_card.CardFooting`: the fit's level-3 card loop, `fit._card._solve.solved`, with Footing's own tasks, each
  row's own ranges and `Held`, the card's FreeHold: Gram-Schmidt on the tasks' reduced Jacobian); its float32 legs'
  joints come back with the frame's own frozen coordinates and the followers set again in float64. mink stays the
  reference and the solve without a card; the test's toy holds the two within 1e-4. RRA's residuals, the trunk's
  moments and the linearisation's sensitivities (`sensitivities`, `CARD_STEPS`) take every frame's state at once on
  the card (`batched`).
- `Footing` holds each leg's free directions where the frame stands them (`FreeHold`, 2026-11-04, #70): the null
  space of the feet's and the pelvis' height's weighted Jacobian over the moving leads, so it moves no foot. A leg has
  more joints than its foot's six directions (the ankle's twist; the knee's shin turn freed from the flexion), and at
  the fit's damping a step along a direction no foot sees was unbounded: env1's seated astronaut's left leg, its
  subtalar on its stop, cycled for good and failed the run (`fit.NotConverged`).
  The directions are the frame's own pose's, fixed for its solve, and its steps judged (`fit.solved(...,
  judged_from=FOOTED_LAM_FIRST)`, Levenberg-Marquardt's control from 1e-6) (2026-11-07, #98): at a straight leg the
  bend left the feet's rank and came back a hair off it, so a hold found again each step held it on one step and let it
  go on the next, and the undamped step at a straight knee bent it 0.7 rad; LabValidation's drop jumps and walks (knees
  straight at take-off, landing and heel strike, GEM-X's a hair past their stop) cycled 300 steps on 67 trials.
  Its judged damping is lowered ten times on every kept step and never put back to 0 (`decaying`, Levenberg-Marquardt's
  own rule), a kept step at no more than its first damping that lowers the cost by under FOOTED_GAIN of it ends the
  frame (a foot no pose reaches), and a frame whose feet already stand where they stood (FOOTED_SETTLED, a micrometre)
  is its own answer, on the card too (2026-11-07, #98): put back to 0, every other step was the undamped one turned
  back and five drop jumps' near-straight legs, their hip's rotation, shin's turn and ankle's twist all but one axis,
  crept 300 steps at 1e-12 to 8e-7 of cost; and RRA's frame check, lowering a move to nothing, got the card's float32
  legs back a rounding off the fitted path. On the card the same: `Held` finds its directions at the solve's first
  pose and keeps them, and the steps are judged with the hold's cost (`fit._card._solve.solved(judged_from=...)`);
  before, a straight leg's frames never stopped there and went to mink. `CardFooting`'s Newton-against-MuJoCo check is
  0.1 mm (`FK_MATCHED`): Newton's float32 forward kinematics stands the right file's bodies 0.003 to 0.011 mm off.
- `within_frames` keeps the move's bones inside SOMA's skin as the fitted path holds them, frame by frame and region by
  region (`fit.FrameSkins`, `skin_excess`, `SKIN_SLACK`), its shares smooth (`held_share`) and the move off the fitted
  path low-passed with the feet kept again (`smoothed_off`) (2026-11-05, #70): the freed joints' pickup kept 0.75 of a
  move that turned the arms and head with the trunk, its hands 37.7% outside the skin, its shins 30 times the clip's
  jerk. The skin is the drawn person moved by the same move (`FrameSkins.outside`'s `moves`: each segment's pose on
  the path over its fitted pose; 2026-11-14): RRA adjusts the kinematics the drawn person plays (the characters layer
  drives its skeleton by the sim body's segments), as OpenSim's RRA adjusts the kinematics it tracks, so the check
  compares like with like. Against the unmoved skin camp's walker kept 1.5% of a move within the owner's 2 cm and 5
  degrees and 86 of its 150 frames stayed over the residual's limits; against the moved skin it kept at least 0.915 of
  it and 44 stayed over.
- `cap_rows` moves, lands and poses the path moved by `total` and each column's nudge of it as one stacked path
  (`moved` takes copies x frames, each frame's couplings' map once; the run's `land` takes whole copies of the clip,
  each against the fitted path), so on the card every nudge's legs are one solve, not one a column; `sensitivities`
  keeps a frame's couplings' map for a nudged state whose leaders stand as the frame's (2026-11-06, #70: the two
  together 19 s in 3 calls of the jump's 135 s). Bit for bit the column-by-column answer: each row's solve is its own.
- `within_follows` keeps RRA's whole move for a fitted path already further off its clip than the `follows` limit
  (#98, 2026-11-07): no move meets a limit the fit itself is past (73 of 90 LabValidation fits 5.0 to 9.4 degrees
  off, every share 0; held at the fit's own measure, RRA's whole move adding 0.36 to 1.04 degrees, still 0), so the
  per-frame cap (`within_frames`) holds it and the `follows` gate fails the fit's own excess.
