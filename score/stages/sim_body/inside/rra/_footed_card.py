"""`Footing` on the card (#70, 2026-11-05; the owner: "should prob just fix that now aswell, so we know what were
working with"): every frame's legs solved at once, one row a frame, by the card loop the fit's level 3 runs on
(`fit._card._solve.solved`: Newton's IK Jacobians, the damped step in the reduced dofs, the exact projection) with
mink's tasks of `_footed.Footing`: each foot body's place and turn (weight 1, as its `FrameTask`), the pelvis' place
(FOOTED_HEIGHT; its place and turn frozen but its height, so its height alone), every leading dof but the legs' and
the root's height frozen, the couplings exact, the legs' leading joints within their ranges or within where `before`
stands them (each row's own bounds), and a leg's free directions held where the frame stands them (`Held`, the card's
`FreeHold`: the projector onto the null space of the tasks' reduced Jacobian at the frame's own pose, by
Gram-Schmidt on the card), each step judged as mink's are (`_footed.FOOTED_LAM_FIRST`). What the
card gives back is float32: the frozen coordinates are the frame's own float64 ones and the followers set again from
their leaders in float64 (`Couplings.apply`), so only the legs' leading joints carry the card's rounding. A frame
the card does not stop in MOST_STEPS (its float32 pose cycling at its floor: 9 of the jump's 180 frames on one call,
2026-11-05), or that it moved a leg joint further than LEAP from the frame (its step run off), is handed back to
`Footing`, which solves it by mink, the reference; never kept half solved."""
