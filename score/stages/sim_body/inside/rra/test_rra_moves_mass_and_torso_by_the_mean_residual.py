"""rra: RRA's model step changes the body's mass by the mean upward residual over its weight, at most MASS_MOST from the
mass it was made with over every round together (the unbounded change recorded as recommended), and moves the torso's
centre of mass under the mean residual moment, at most COM_MOST from where it was made; the feet stay where they stood
when the pelvis moves (`Footing`, mink), a leg's direction no foot task sees held where the frame stood
(`FreeHold`), and a frame that does not converge fails loudly; as worked out by hand (to 1e-6: Newton keeps gravity
in float32); a segment's turn between two posed paths is measured in degrees; RRA's frame shares are held smooth
and never above what the frame check lowered them to, a move putting bones out of SOMA's skin is seen region by region
against the fitted path, and only the move off the fitted path is low-passed (#70, 2026-11-05); the caps' rows of
every nudge landed as one stacked path, and the card's sensitivities with a frame's couplings' map kept where its
leaders stand, are each nudge's own bits (2026-11-06). It runs in Newton's
own Python (on a model Newton builds; score/stages/physics/inside/newton_env.sh, built at $PROPS_HOME/envs/newton_env): with none
built there, as in `make tests`' sandbox home, it prints `skipped`.

Breaks (each applied once with the env linked into a sandbox home, seen red, reverted), 2026-10-28:
- reweighed's `share = -float(np.mean(residuals[:, 2]))` made `share = float(...)`: the body gets lighter when the
  ground must carry more.
- reweighed's `np.clip(recommended, -MASS_MOST, MASS_MOST)` made `recommended`: a floating body loses all its mass
  (2026-10-29).
- reweighed's `model.body_mass[:] = made[0] * (1 + share)` made `model.body_mass[:] *= 1 + share`: the bound
  compounds round after round, three rounds take the body to 0.98 ** 3 (2026-10-29).
- Footing.footed's `self.tasks + [self.height]` made `[self.height]`: the feet ride the moved pelvis, 2 cm off
  (2026-10-29).
- fit._frames.solved's `raise NotConverged(...)` made `return configuration.q.copy()`: a frame cut off at its
  last step is kept silently (2026-10-29).
- reweighed's `np.clip(model.body_ipos[torso] + shift - home, -COM_MOST, COM_MOST)` made `model.body_ipos[torso] +
  shift - home`: the torso's centre of mass moves past RRA's 0.1 m.
- Footing.footed's `limit.lower, limit.upper = np.minimum(lower, still), np.maximum(upper, still)` dropped: a knee
  the fitted path carries past its stop is pulled in with no move (camp, 2026-11-03).
- Footing.footed's `self.hold.set_target(qpos)` made `self.hold.set_target(still)`: the shin's turn and the ankle's
  twist go back to where `before` stood them, a direction no foot sees moved (2026-11-04).
- Footing.footed's `found[unstopped] = self._mink(...)` dropped: a frame the card did not stop is kept half solved
  (2026-11-05).
- `_footed_card.Held` finding its directions at every step (`self.found` never set) together with CardFooting's
  `judged_from=FOOTED_LAM_FIRST` dropped (the card before 2026-11-07): the straight legs' frames 3 and 4 not stopped
  on the card; Footing.footed's `settled` skip dropped: unmoved frames came back 7.6e-7 off (the card's float32 legs)
  (2026-11-07, on an L4).
- FreeHold's `self.free` (its directions found at the frame's own pose) made `self._free(configuration)` (found again
  at each step): the hold's directions at a leg bent 0.02 rad off straight 0.67 off the straight frame's; Footing's
  `judged_from=FOOTED_LAM_FIRST` dropped: the straight knees past their stop cycle, 300 steps; FOOTED_LAM_FIRST made
  the fit's 1e-3: the knees 0.03 past their stop under a pelvis 5 mm up crawl 300 steps (2026-11-07).
- within_follows' `if off_clip(...path...) > follows: return adjusted, 1.0` dropped: a fit past the limit keeps none
  of RRA's move (#98, 2026-11-07).
- fit.judged_solve's `decaying` dropped (the judged damping put back to 0 after each kept step, as before): both legs
  turning about their long axes, 0.002 rad off straight, under a pelvis turned 0.01 rad, 300 steps; Footing's
  `gain=FOOTED_GAIN` dropped: the left leg alone turning under a pelvis turned 0.05 rad, 300 steps (2026-11-07).
- FreeHold._free's `turns[rank:]` made `turns[:rank]` (the directions the feet see held instead): the feet 15 mm off
  (2026-11-04).

- rra._cap.held_share's `np.convolve(padded, ...)` made `smoothed(lowered, rate)` with `np.minimum(lowered, ...)`
  (the rule before): the dip's whole 0.7 kept as one step; its erosion's `2 * radius + 1` made `1`: the average
  rises above the lowered share beside the dip (2026-11-05).
- rra._cap.skin_excess' `- fitted[...]` dropped: a region already out on the fitted path counts as put out; its
  `labels == label` made all vertices: region b's half read as a quarter (2026-11-05).
- rra._cap.smoothed_off's `smoothed(offsets, rate)` dropped: the shake kept; its offsets taken off the zero pose
  instead of `before`: the walk itself low-passed (2026-11-05).
- rra._linear.wrenches' `places - summed[:, None] * origin` made `places - origin`, and its `summed[:, None, None] *
  edges` made `edges`: the blended point's columns off its Jacobian's; residuals_kept's key without the masses: moved
  masses read the kept residuals (2026-11-06).
- rra._linear.sensitivities' `mapped if same else couplings.map(placed)` made `mapped`: a lumbar nudge's trunk rows
  read the frame's map, not its own; rra._cap.cap_rows' `found[1 + column]` made `found[column]`: a stacked nudge read
  as its neighbour's (2026-11-06).
