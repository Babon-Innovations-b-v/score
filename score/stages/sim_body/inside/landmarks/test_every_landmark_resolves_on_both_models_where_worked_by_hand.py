"""landmarks: every landmark of SCORE's set resolves on both models (a face of SOMA's template topology with
barycentric weights, on a SOMA segment; a MyoFullBody body of that segment's bone group), each left landmark is its
right one mirrored; a landmark is its face's barycentric point on a person's mesh, and on the clip's skin its corners'
skinned moves' (each corner its joints' weighted moves from the bind); a SOMA joint end is its joint, the hip joints'
middle or the hand's tip; a knuckle's skin point stands within KNUCKLE_SKIN of its bone point (all worked out by
hand; pure: the score venv runs it).

Breaks (each applied once, seen red, reverted):
- (2026-10-28) on_skin's `np.asarray(row[1]) @ points[faces[row[0]]]` made `points[faces[row[0]]].mean(axis=0)`:
  every landmark at its face's middle.
- (2026-10-28) soma_point's `1.0 - TIP_SHARE` made `0.5`: the hand's tip is its far half's middle.
- (2026-10-28) posed's `np.asarray(worlds, dtype=float) @ np.linalg.inv(bind)` made `np.asarray(worlds,
  dtype=float)`: a joint's move is its frame, not its move from the bind.
- (2026-10-28) posed's `np.einsum("lcs,flcsi->flci", weights, moved)` made `moved[..., 0, :]`: every corner moves
  with its first segment only.
- (2026-10-29) _table's ASIS_r bone point x `0` made `0.01`: the right ASIS is 1 cm off the left's mirror.
- (2026-10-29) _table's spinous_L4 body `lumbar4` made `lumbar3`: it no longer resolves in its segment's group.
- (2026-10-29) _table's MT1_head_l face `3570` made `9100`: past the template's faces.
- (2026-10-29) _table's MC3_head_r trust `0.098` made `0.099` (the study's own side): its trust is not the left's.
- (2026-11-01) _table's MC5_head_l link `(-0.01197, -0.00386, -0.00927)` made the study's `(0.01192, 0.00289,
  -0.02595)`: its skin point 29 mm off the bone, on the ring finger's knuckle.
- (2026-11-04) HELD's `"head_side_l"` made `"head_side"`: a held name that is no landmark, so nothing is held there.
