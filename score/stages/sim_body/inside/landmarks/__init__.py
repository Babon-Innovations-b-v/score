"""SCORE's landmark set (#70; CONTEXT.md "landmark set"; pure numpy): each landmark linked once to a point of the SOMA
mesh and to a point on MyoFullBody's bones (`LANDMARKS`), MyoFullBody's own joint centres (`CENTRES`: the group ends'
and the measure's), each landmark found on a person's mesh (`on_skin`) and skinned on the clip (`posed`), and SOMA's own
joints as group ends for the fit, the measure and the masses (`soma_point`, `soma_joints`, `myo_parts`), and each
segment's bind frame at its group's start for the skin the ground pushes (`at_starts`). The links and
trusts are level 1's (`tuning`, over many bodies at once).

How the set was found (landmark study, 2026-10-29, scripts kept with the study, not here): every MyoFullBody point by
its anatomical definition, an extreme-vertex rule on one bone mesh (ISB: Wu et al. 2002, 2005; Leardini 2007 for the
foot; Van Sint Jan 2007's atlas), no dataset's marker list read; each carried into SOMA's bind by its bone group's
aligned anatomical frames and length, then a ray along its outward direction met SOMA's skin (a tip: the nearest skin
vertex). A landmark's link is where the skin stood off the carried bone point on the template, turned into the body's
frame; its trust started at s0^2 / (s0^2 + slide^2 + placement^2), s0 5 mm (slide: its skin's move off a rigid point
when SOMA's skin plays the rig's clips), and both are level 1's to set (`tuning`). Measure-only (`solver`
False): the scapula's angles and trigonum (SOMA has no scapula: its back skin blends Chest and Shoulder), the greater
tubercle, the olecranon and the finger tips (SOMA has no finger joints, MyoFullBody's fingers are held)."""
