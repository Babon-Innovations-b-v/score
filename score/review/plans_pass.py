"""The sync pass's `plans keep` (score/dashboard/sync/client.py plans_kept), made fast: plans.main(["keep"]) inside one
moment (plans.one_moment: each place's plan made once, not once a question) with the folder store's key lookups
walking only the folder a prefix names (narrow_keys).

    .venv/bin/python -m score.review.plans_pass       # what `python -m score.review.plans keep` does, in seconds

A pass took 10 to 12 min, about 7 in `plans keep` (2026-10-24): every Store.keys walked the whole store (5,400
objects) and current() asked it about 25 times a place, again for every question about the place. Both fixes live
here, in a module no stage imports, so they are in no row's key: plans.py and tools/cloud/runtime/store.py are in the
code version of every stage that reads them (an edit to either re-keyed about 50 paid rows, `score.stages.moved`).
The answers are the same; `keep` writes only the files the stages read and starts the plan writing in a process of
its own, never a store write the moment would hide.
