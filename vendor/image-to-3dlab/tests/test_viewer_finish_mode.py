"""Static wiring checks for the Finish mode and the Pixal3D backend option.

`finish.js` touches the DOM at import time, so it cannot be executed under Node the way
`job-progress.js` is. The failure mode worth catching is cheaper than that anyway: a
`getElementById` in the module that no longer matches an id in `index.html` silently yields
null, and the panel breaks at the moment someone tries to use it. These tests read both
files and compare.
