"""Tests for the MLX sparse-attention patch.

These import the real patch functions rather than re-deriving them, so what is tested is
what ships. The three properties that matter for any patch script here: the anchor must be
present or it fails closed, re-running must be a no-op, and the injected code must import
everything it uses rather than assuming the host file's imports.
