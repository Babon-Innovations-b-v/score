"""Start, check and stop background jobs the same way on every platform.

Each viewer job runs in its own process group so stopping it also stops its children.
POSIX does that with sessions and `os.killpg`; Windows has neither, so it gets a new
process group at start and `taskkill /T` (kill the whole tree) at stop. Found on the first
real Windows run (issue #36): `os.killpg` does not exist there.
