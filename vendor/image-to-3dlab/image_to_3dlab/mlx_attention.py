"""Fused attention for TRELLIS.2 on Apple Silicon, via MLX.

Why this exists
---------------
TRELLIS.2-4B is 1536 wide over 12 heads, so its head dimension is 128. PyTorch's MPS
backend has no fused attention kernel, and Pedro's Metal kernel only supports head
dimensions through 64, so the model falls back to unfused SDPA that materialises the whole
score matrix. Measured 2026-09-20 at the real Stage-3 shape (9,801 tokens, 12 heads, head
dim 128), attention is 93.2% of sampling time, and sampling is 68% of a 1024 run.

MLX has a fused kernel that handles head dimension 128. At that shape it is 3.2x faster
than torch MPS SDPA at fp32 and 13.8x at fp16. Even converting tensors through host memory
on every call - which is what this module does, because MLX 0.31.2 exposes no zero-copy
path from an MPS tensor - it stays 2.83x and 9.35x ahead respectively.

The functions here are deliberately plain and importable so they can be unit-tested. The
vendored TRELLIS tree only gets a thin dispatch branch that calls into them, injected by
``scripts/patch_trellis_mlx_attention.py``.

Numerics
--------
MLX and torch agree to roughly 1e-4 at fp32, which is reduction-order difference rather
than error. That is small but not nothing, and this repository has previously been caught
out by changes of that size affecting colour and guidance behaviour. fp32 is therefore the
default; fp16 is opt-in through ``I2L_MLX_ATTN_DTYPE=fp16`` and must be validated on a real
generated asset before being trusted.
