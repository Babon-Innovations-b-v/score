"""Repaint a generated head's eyes into a dedicated high-resolution patch.

**The problem this exists for.** Image-to-3D backends do not model eyes. They paint
them, into the same atlas that carries the whole body, at whatever resolution the
atlas happens to allocate -- and eyes are small, so they get almost nothing. On the
moss fox (TRELLIS, 2026-09-19) a clay render of the head shows a smooth muzzle with a
faint mound where each eye belongs, and the 1024x1024 atlas spends about 1,500 texels
on each eye: roughly a 25x25 patch once the lids are subtracted. At that size there is
no iris edge, no pupil and no highlight, just a smear a couple of dozen pixels wide,
and the two eyes usually do not even match, because the generator hallucinated each
side independently. Every backend in this repository has the same failure mode; the
fox is only the asset it was first measured on.

**Why a patch instead of repainting the atlas.** Growing the shared atlas to fix a
1% region costs 4x or 16x the texture for no gain anywhere else, and TRELLIS atlases
are shattered into hundreds of tiny islands, so an eye is not one contiguous area you
can paint by hand. Instead each eye gets its own small material and its own planar UV
projection: the eye faces are re-unwrapped along the gaze axis into half of one patch
image, which makes the mapping between a texel and a point on the face analytic. At a
1024x512 patch each eye gets ~300 texels across instead of ~25, and the shared atlas
is left untouched.

**How the surrounding fur survives.** The patch is not painted from scratch. The eye
faces are rasterised into patch space first, interpolating their *original* atlas UVs,
so the patch starts as a resampled copy of what was already there. Only the eye itself
is painted over the top, and it fades into that copy, so the boundary between the patch
material and the atlas material shows the same colour on both sides.

**Placement is measured, not guessed.** ``locate_eye`` finds the dark almond in the
resampled patch by image moments -- centre, tilt and extent -- so the new eye lands
exactly where the generator put the old one, which is what keeps it consistent with
the eyelid shading painted around it. That is also what makes this work on a creature
it has never seen: the only per-asset input is a rough point inside each eye.

Run it against a live Blender (the same execute_code socket every other ``blender_*``
helper in this repo uses). The two centres are approximate -- anywhere inside the eye
is close enough, the moment fit does the rest -- and the left of the head comes first::

    python scripts/paint_eyes.py --object geometry_0 \\
        --eye -0.0777 -0.408 0.6282 --eye 0.0114 -0.3569 0.6229

Everything about the eye itself is a knob, because creatures differ::

    # a pale blue eye with a slit pupil, on a character called "snag"
    python scripts/paint_eyes.py --object snag --material SnagEyes \\
        --eye ... --eye ... --iris "#6f9ec4" --pupil-scale 0.22

``--revert`` undoes the whole edit, ``--export`` writes a GLB without the working UV
layer, and both need only ``--object``.

**What it assumes about the asset**: one triangulated mesh whose first material feeds
base colour from an image texture. A metallic/roughness texture is used if the
material has one and synthesised from the material's constant values if it does not.
Faces are found by projecting along the gaze, so it suits a head with normal eye
placement; a creature with eyes on stalks or on top of its skull wants ``--forward``.
