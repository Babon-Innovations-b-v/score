"""Author a natural walk, trot or scamper on any Rigify basic-quadruped rig.

    blender --background rigged.blend --python scripts/blender_quadruped_walk.py -- \
        --gait walk --frames 32 --out walked.blend

The gait maths lives in `quadruped_gait.py` as pure functions; this file is the thin
`bpy` layer that measures the rig, converts world-space offsets into each bone's local
space, and keys them.

Two decisions worth knowing. The legs are keyed as **IK foot targets**, so the script
sets `IK_FK` to 0.0 on the four leg parents rather than assuming it -- keying IK controls
while the rig is in FK mode authors curves that the constraints then ignore, which looks
exactly like the script silently failing. And the **body chain is keyed too**: the
rejected generic cycle left `hips`, `torso` and `chest` with zero motion, which is what
made it read as a marionette rather than an animal.

Stride and lift are multiples of *this* rig's own leg lengths, never absolute numbers
copied between creatures -- the ram and the fox are within 5% in height but have inverted
limb segments, so shared absolutes over-reach the IK targets and skate the feet.
