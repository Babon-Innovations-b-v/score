"""Find model weights stored twice, and optionally reclaim the duplicates.

    python scripts/audit_model_weights.py               # dry run, prints a report
    python scripts/audit_model_weights.py --apply       # actually delete
    python scripts/audit_model_weights.py --rule ckpt   # one rule only

**Why this exists.** An audit on 2026-09-21 found a 104 GB Hugging Face cache holding
roughly 65 GB that nothing needed: a rejected PyTorch port still cached in full, a model
kept in two formats because the converter never deleted its input, and two mirrors of the
same image encoder. None of it was visible without walking the disk, and none of it would
have been noticed by eye.

**It deletes nothing by default.** `--apply` is required, every candidate is printed with
its size first, and the rules below only ever propose a path under a root passed in.

Three rules, in descending order of how sure they are:

1. ``ckpt`` — a ``.ckpt`` sitting beside a ``.safetensors`` of the same stem. The
   checkpoint was the download; the safetensors is the converted result the loader
   actually opens. Provable from the filesystem, so safe to delete.
2. ``cached`` — a Hugging Face cache entry whose files are also present as real (non
   symlinked) files under a local weights directory. The cache copy is then a second
   physical copy, not the one in use. Matched on file name and exact size.
3. ``unreferenced`` — a cache entry whose repo id appears in no tracked source file.
   **Reported only, never deleted**, because "nothing greps for it" is evidence about our
   code, not about whether something on this machine needs it.
