"""Download Hunyuan3D-MLX weights from Hugging Face.

Fetches shape-stage weights (2.1, 2.0, 2.0-turbo -- pick one with --model, or omit for
all three) into shape/weights/, and paint-stage weights into paint/weights/. Same source
repos Xiong's own dl_any.py/dl_modelscope.py pull from ModelScope, just via Hugging Face
Hub instead -- ModelScope was a region workaround for the original author, not something
needed here; verified 2026-08-19 that both tencent/Hunyuan3D-2 and tencent/Hunyuan3D-2.1
are directly reachable.

2.1 ships only a .ckpt on HF; this converts it to the .safetensors format the shape
pipeline actually loads, via shape/scripts/convert_v21_ckpt.py.

Paint weights come from Xiong's own MLX-ready repo, not Tencent's. Tencent's
hunyuan3d-paintpbr-v2-1 ships the UNet as a torch .bin and has no DINOv2 or VAE, so a
fresh install from it could not paint (issue #65). Xiong's repo is the same Tencent
weights, converted: UNet, VAE, DINOv2-giant and RealESRGAN, in the layout the paint
code loads.

Usage:
