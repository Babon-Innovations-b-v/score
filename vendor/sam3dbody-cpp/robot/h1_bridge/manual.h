// manual.h — slider teleop (h1_bridge --manual): the operator's target source.
//
// Pure logic, no UI and no SDK (unit-tested in test_bridge.cpp).  The UI only edits a
// PENDING pose; nothing moves until Apply, and Apply is accepted only if
// check_manual_pose() passes.  The accepted pose is then walked toward along a
// straight joint-space line, slower than the Supervisor's follower, so the path that
// was collision-checked is the path that is actually driven.  Everything still goes
// through the Supervisor (limits, velocity, per-step collision gate, deadman).
