# tools/trt_env.sh — sourceable helper (do NOT exec; it must export into your shell)
#
# Puts the bundled TensorRT runtime libs on LD_LIBRARY_PATH so ORT 1.20.1's
# TensorRT EP can dlopen libnvinfer.so.10 / libnvonnxparser.so.10 /
# libnvinfer_plugin.so.10 (see DEPENDENCIES.md §6).  Libs are installed into
# the project venv/ by tools/setup_trt.sh.  No-op if not installed, so
# sourcing it is always safe even when you aren't passing --trt.
#
# Usage (from any wrapper script):
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../tools/trt_env.sh"
#
# Auto-detects the venv's python<ver> directory via a glob, so it is not pinned
# to one Python version.  Exports SAM3D_TRT_LIBS = the resolved dir ("" if none).
#
# Searches both the project venv/ (setup_trt.sh's target) and tools/.venv/
# (where run_trt.sh's one-time `pip install tensorrt-cu12-libs` puts them), so a
# stack set up either way resolves the same.

# Resolve repo root from THIS file's location (independent of the caller's CWD).
