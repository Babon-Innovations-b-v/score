# Domain Awareness

Consumer rules for any skill that explores this codebase. Producer rules (writing to the glossary, offering ADRs) live in the `grill` skill.

## Before exploring, read these

- **[`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md)** — the glossary at the repo root. It picks the canonical term for each concept and lists the `_Avoid_:` aliases.
- **The relevant [`docs/bible.md`](../../docs/bible.md) chapter** — pick from the chapter map in root `CLAUDE.md`. Read only the chapter(s) the prompt touches; not the whole file.
- **[`docs/adr/`](../../docs/adr/)** — read the ADRs that touch the area you are about to work in. The index is `docs/adr/0000-index.md`.

If any of these have no content for your topic, **proceed silently**. Don't flag the absence; don't suggest creating something upfront. The producer skill (`grill`) creates entries lazily, when a term or a decision actually gets resolved.

## One glossary, one bible

This repo uses one bible file (`docs/bible.md`) and one glossary (`CONTEXT.md`). No split map, no second glossary. Per-directory `CLAUDE.md` overlays are thin pointers to the relevant bible chapter, not separate contexts.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, test name, agent prompt), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to a synonym the glossary explicitly avoids (`_Avoid_:` line).

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it; the next `grill` session will fill it).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0002 (no loose files outside the carve-out), but worth reopening because…_

Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids. Only surface a conflict when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the decision.

## Skills that obey this contract

- `grill` (producer and consumer)
- `to-prd`
- `improve-codebase-architecture`
- `zoom-out`
- `diagnose`
- `prototype`
- `handoff`
- `tdd`
