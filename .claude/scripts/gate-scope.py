"""Decide whether a change needs the project's tests at all, before the gate runs them.

A spawned project starts with the part every project can use: a change that touches only
documents and working notes runs nothing, and anything else runs everything. When the full run
gets slow, grow this into a graph that picks only the suites a change can reach (see
build/release in the bible for the rules, and farm-factory's tools/test/scope/ for a grown one).

The rules, which a grown version keeps:
- Unknown means full. A path this file does not recognise, no origin/main to compare with,
  `--full`, GATE_FULL=1, or a run on CI: everything runs.
- CI always runs everything. It is the net under whatever a scoped local run skips.
- Only documents changed: nothing runs.

Run: python3 .claude/scripts/gate-scope.py [--full]
Prints MODE none|full, then WHY lines saying why. The gate reads the MODE line.
