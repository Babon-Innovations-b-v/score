"""Reap orphaned git worktrees left behind by crashed Claude sessions.

Each Claude worktree under .claude/worktrees/ is locked while its session is live, and the lock
reason carries the session pid. A crash leaves the lock behind, and every later session skips the
worktree as "in use by another live session" forever.

A worktree is reaped only when its lock pid is dead AND it is clean (no uncommitted changes, HEAD
already on origin/main). Dirty orphans are reported, never deleted, so no work is lost. An unlocked
worktree (a finished agent's, or one made by hand) is reaped only when it is clean and merged AND
untouched for IDLE_HOURS, because finished agents leave many of them behind: they fill the disk, and
they sit inside the repository tree, where a check that walks the tree finds files from other
branches. A dirty or unmerged unlocked one is never touched.

Run standalone (`python3 .claude/scripts/worktree-reap.py`) or via the SessionStart hook. Exit
status is always 0 so it never blocks a session.
