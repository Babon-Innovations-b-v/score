"""Reap orphaned git worktrees left behind by crashed Claude sessions.

Each Claude worktree under .claude/worktrees/ is locked while its session is live, and the lock
reason carries the session pid. A crash leaves the lock behind, and every later session skips the
worktree as "in use by another live session" forever.

A worktree is reaped only when its lock pid is dead AND it is clean (no uncommitted changes, HEAD
already on origin/main). Dirty orphans are reported, never deleted, so no work is lost. Unlocked
worktrees (kept on purpose, or made by hand) are never touched.

Run standalone (`python3 .claude/scripts/worktree-reap.py`) or via the SessionStart hook. Exit
status is always 0 so it never blocks a session.
