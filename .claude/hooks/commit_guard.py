"""PreToolUse guard: a session may not route around the torn-commit guard.

Reads the Claude Code PreToolUse hook payload on stdin (``{tool_name,
tool_input, cwd, ...}``) and blocks two things, both on TOKENS via shlex, so a
quoted commit message can never trip them (the same fix issue_guard.py
carries for `git push -f`):

1. THE BYPASS. ``git commit --no-verify`` / ``-n``, or a command whose
   environment prefix sets ``TORN_GUARD=0`` or ``LEFTOVER_GUARD=0``.
   Those overrides exist for a human at a terminal who can see what they are
   waiving. A session waiving them gets the torn commit the guard exists to
   stop, with an extra step.

2. THE SHARED CHECKOUT, gated by ``WORKTREE_GUARD`` (default "1", armed). A
   ``git commit`` in the MAIN checkout is blocked while another session's
   worktree under ``.claude/worktrees/`` holds a live lock, and the message
   says how to move. It judges the repository the COMMAND targets, not the one
   the session sits in (``target_cwd``), so a commit in another repository on
   this machine is that repository's business. It is armed by default because
   the worktree habit does not arrive on its own: several sessions sharing one
   checkout tear commits, publish each other's work and rebase under each other.

   Note what it does NOT do, so nobody reads more safety into it than is there:
   it fires only while some OTHER session is live in a worktree. If everybody is
   in the shared checkout it never fires at all. It makes the shared checkout
   uncomfortable once anyone has moved out; it cannot make anyone move.
   ``WORKTREE_GUARD=0`` disarms it.

FAILURE POLICY: fail-open. Any parse error, unknown shape, or unrelated call
exits 0 (allow). Exit 2 + stderr is the only block path (the harness feeds
stderr back to the model as the block reason).
