"""Stop hook: the two soul rules that a machine can check, checked.

`.claude/soul.md` is replayed into every prompt by the UserPromptSubmit hook,
and replaying a rule is asking for it. Prose in a prompt is a request rather
than a rule: sessions break rules 2, 3 and 5 in their own replies while
explaining why prose does not work. So this is the seam.

Two rules and no more, because only two are mechanically decidable:

- Rule 3, no em dashes. Exact, no judgement, no false positive.
- Rules 2 and 5, length tracks the answer and not the prompt. Not decidable as
  written ("the shortest version that is still fully clear" is a judgement), so
  what is checked is the proxy the failure actually takes: a long reply to a
  short question that did not ask for detail.

Rules 1, 4, 6 and 7 (plain language, no preamble, warmth, English) stay
requests. A word list cannot tell jargon from the right technical term, and a
guard that looks like protection and is not is worse than none.

It blocks at most ONCE per stop, and a re-sent reply goes through. That is
deliberate and its shape is nudge, then allow. A long
answer is sometimes the right answer, and a guard that can veto one would be a
guard that suppresses a report. What it buys is that the length is chosen
rather than drifted into.

FAILURE POLICY: fail-open. Anything unreadable, any unexpected shape, any
exception exits 0 with no output, which ends the turn normally. A session that
cannot answer is worse than a session that answers too long.
`SOUL_GUARD=0` disarms it.
