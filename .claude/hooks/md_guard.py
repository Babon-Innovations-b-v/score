"""PreToolUse guard: a new markdown file needs the user's go-ahead.

Reads the Claude Code PreToolUse payload on stdin and blocks creating a ``.md`` that does not exist yet anywhere under
the repo, by ``Write`` or by a Bash redirect (``>``, ``>>``), ``tee``, ``touch`` or ``cp`` with a ``.md``
destination.

Allowed:

- editing an existing ``.md``;
- anything outside the repo (``/tmp``, a job scratch dir), which is where generated pages belong;
- ``mv`` and ``git mv``: a rename leaves the count unchanged (``cp`` adds a file, so it still counts);
- a per-directory ``CLAUDE.md`` overlay, the standing exception: it is the mechanism that loads a directory's rules,
  so a code directory without one is a gap, not a document;
- ``.claude/memory/``: private working notes;
- a file the user asked for: when one of the person's last twenty typed messages in the session transcript names an
  md or markdown file, the creation goes through (tool results do not count, they are the machine talking);
- a path listed in ``.claude/hooks/local/md_allowed.json`` with the user's words and the time, when the repository
  keeps such a list (``[{"path": ..., "words": ..., "at": ...}]``; an entry without words does not count).

Why: every markdown file in a repository run this way is living, read by someone and kept current. A summary file
dropped at a session's end has nobody keeping it current and the next session reads it as truth, so each new file is
the user's decision, not a side effect of a session.

FAILURE POLICY: fail-open. Any parse error, unknown shape or unrelated call exits 0 (allow). Exit 2 + stderr is the
only block path (the harness feeds stderr back to the model as the block reason).
