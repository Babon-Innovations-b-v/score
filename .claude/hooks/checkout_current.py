"""Session-start and stop hook: keep the shared checkout on `main` current, and
say so when it cannot.

It replaces a one-line shell blob (`git rebase -q --autostash origin/main
2>/dev/null || { git rebase --abort; exit 0; }`) that did the same work and
threw every failure away: silent on the fetch failing, on the rebase failing,
on the push failing. An unresolved merge in the shared checkout makes
`--autostash` fail on every session end, and with the blob nobody is told; the
first sign is some unrelated hook erroring because the checkout never received
it.

So the rule this hook exists to hold is not "catch the checkout up". It is
**never fail silently at this**. Catching up is best effort; reporting is not.

**It does not resolve anything.** A conflict needs a person, and a hook that
started resolving files on its own is a worse problem than the one it solves.
It reports the reason git gave, names the command to run, and gets out of the
way.

**It runs against `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, on purpose**, which is the shared
checkout even for a worktree session. This hook is *about* the shared checkout,
so a worktree session ending is exactly the moment worth using to check on it.

Once per session, because a session ending twice is not two problems.

**BOTH ENDS.** Catching up only at the end has a hole with two shapes. A session
that starts hours after the last one ended, or after somebody pushed from
another machine, spends its whole life on a checkout nobody has moved; and a
session that is killed rather than stopped never runs the Stop half at all.
Both are invisible, because a stale checkout does not fail, it just quietly
answers about old code.

At session start it does the catching up and the reporting and nothing else:
saving memory and pushing are things a session has earned by the end and has
not earned at the beginning. `CLAUDE_HOOK=SessionStart` in the hook's command
is what says which end it is. Memory is committed only where the repository
tracks `.claude/memory`; where it is git-ignored, git reports nothing to save.

**Run it before any session-start hook that compares something against the
shared checkout's HEAD** (a repository index, say): run first, that hook would
call a checkout that is ten commits behind `origin/main` "current".

FAILURE POLICY: never blocks, never raises, always exits 0. It writes to stderr,
which the harness shows as a note. `CHECKOUT_CURRENT=0` disarms it.
