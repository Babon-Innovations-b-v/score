"""The push cap: a push to main is refused once the day's pushes to main reach the day's limit, counted over every
repository on this machine that reads the same cap config.

Each push to main starts a gate run somewhere, and a gate run costs money; a day's limit keeps work batched into few
pushes. The shared pre-push hook runs `claim` before the repository's own pre-push and `release` when that one refused
the push, so a refused push holds no slot. A push the remote refused (git has no hook after the transfer) gives its
slot back at the next claim from this repository: an earlier push of this repository, at least SETTLE_SECONDS old,
whose commit git holds and which origin's main (refs/remotes/origin/main, moved by every push the remote took) does
not contain, never reached main (2026-11-09: a push the remote refused as not a fast-forward held its slot). A push
git cannot judge (its commit not here, no origin/main) keeps its slot.

    push_cap.py claim     push lines on stdin; exit 1 (and why on stderr) when today's limit is reached, else 0
                          with the push recorded in the ledger
    push_cap.py release   push lines on stdin; takes this push's claim back out of the ledger

THE CONFIG is JSON at $HARNESS_PUSH_CAP, else ~/.config/harness/push-cap.json; with no file there is no cap:

    {"limits": [{"from": "2026-11-09", "per_day": 6}, {"from": "2026-11-13", "per_day": 4}],
     "ledger": "~/.config/harness/push-cap-ledger.json"}

Days are UTC. Today's limit is the `per_day` of the latest entry whose `from` is today or earlier; none, or a
`per_day` of null, is no cap. `ledger` defaults to push-cap-ledger.json beside the config; every repository naming
the same ledger shares one count. The ledger keeps 14 days of pushes: {"<day>": [{"repo", "sha", "at"}]}.

Deletions and pushes to other branches pass at once and are not counted. FAILURE POLICY: a config or ledger that
exists but cannot be read is a refusal naming the file (a cap someone set is never skipped silently); a push line
that cannot be read is no push to main.
