"""The test rule's guard (tools/test_rule/check.py) finds every way a repository breaks the rule and nothing else: one
test file a module, named test_<invariant>.py, its docstring naming the break that turns it red, and one test function
a file (owner, 2026-11-01), a script's checks counted, a note never growing a file, pytest finding every file's test,
no SyntaxWarning, the allowlist only shrinking and a run that printed skipped not passing (2026-11-07). ONE TEST,
parametrized: each case builds a small git repository in a temp folder and lists by hand the faults the rule says it
has; nothing reads this repository.

Breaks (each applied once, seen red, reverted), in tools/test_rule/check.py:
- one file a module: faults' `if len(files) > 1:` -> `if len(files) > 2:` (two files in one module pass).
- a tests/ folder is its parent's: module_of's `if folder.name == "tests":` -> `if False:`.
- named for its invariant: file_faults' `if not path.name.startswith("test_"):` -> `if False:`.
- the break line: file_faults' `elif not BREAK_LINE.search(...)` -> `elif False:`; and BREAK_LINE's `.{0,200}?` ->
  `.*?` (a "break" and a "red" pages apart pass).
- flat tool folders: module_of's `if str(path.parent) in FLAT_TOOL_FOLDERS:` -> `if False:`.
- a tool named as a script before a bare name: named_tool's patterns tried bare name first (`r"\\b(\\w+)\\b"` moved to
  the front).
- the allowlist: faults' `if allowlisted(path, allowlist):` -> `if False:`; allowlist_faults' `if not covered:`,
  `elif count[0] > owed[0] or ...:` and `elif count != tuple(owed):` each -> `if False:`/`elif False:`.
- vendor/ and ignored files left out, new files counted: is_test_file's vendor clause dropped; test_files'
  `"--exclude-standard"` dropped; test_files' `"--others"` dropped.
- only the named modules: faults' `if wanted and not wanted & ...:` -> `if False:`.
- one function a file: count_faults' `if count > 1 and not SECOND_TEST...` -> `if False:`; test_count's `Test*` class
  branch dropped; SECOND_TEST's `second test:` -> `xsecond test:`.
- the function debt only shrinks: count_faults' `if count > owed:`, `if count <= 1:` and `if count < owed:` each ->
  `if False:`; faults' stale-entry list dropped.
- a script's checks count: script_checks returns `set()`; its `check_` -> `xcheck_`; its `CHECKS` -> `XCHECKS`.
- a note never grows a file: count_faults' `if count > before:` -> `if False:`; base_count's `{base}:` -> `HEAD:`.
- pytest finds every file's test: main_faults' `if only and str(path) not in main_only:` -> `if False:`; its
  `if not only and ...` -> `if False:`; runs_only_under_main's `if tree is None or pytest_tests(tree):` ->
  `if tree is None:`; stale_faults' MAIN_ONLY pair dropped.
- no SyntaxWarning: file_faults' warning list -> `[]`.
- a run that printed skipped fails: ran_faults' `skipped = any(...)` -> `skipped = False`; ONLY_SKIPS' ` skipped\\b`
  -> ` xskipped\\b`; the MAY_SKIP `fnmatch` -> `False`.
